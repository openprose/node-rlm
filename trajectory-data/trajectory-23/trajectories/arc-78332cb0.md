# Trajectory: arc-78332cb0

## Task Summary

ARC task requiring grid transformation with blocks separated by rows/columns of 6s.
The task involves rearranging 5x5 blocks within grids, with inputs containing 2x2 grids or linear arrangements of blocks.
Agent timed out after 9 iterations without producing an answer, spending all time on exploratory analysis.

## Control Flow

```
iter 0  EXPLORE     print all training examples with dimensions
iter 1  EXPLORE     count non-7 cells in each block, attempted output as object
iter 2  EXPLORE     fix logging to show count/color arrays
iter 3  EXPLORE     compute bounding box metrics for all blocks
iter 4  EXPLORE     compute same metrics for Train 2
iter 5  EXPLORE     compare input blocks to output blocks, print grids
iter 6  EXPLORE     examine Train 1 input/output blocks visually
iter 7  EXPLORE     print Train 2 input/output to analyze ordering
iter 8  EXPLORE     compute perimeter for Train 0 blocks
iter 9  ABORT       aborted mid-exploration (attempting to check if blocks are transposed)
```

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Continuous Exploration (iter 0-9)
**Strategy:** Exhaustive metric computation to find the transformation rule
**Effectiveness:** Completely ineffective — never transitioned to hypothesis testing

The agent spent all 9 iterations in pure exploration mode:
- iter 0: Printed training grids (reasonable start)
- iter 1-2: Counted non-7 cells per block
- iter 3-4: Computed bounding boxes (height, width, area)
- iter 5-7: Printed blocks visually to compare input/output
- iter 8: Computed perimeter metrics
- iter 9: Aborted while attempting yet another visual comparison

**Pattern:** The agent kept computing new features (count, bounding box, perimeter) hoping to find a simple sorting rule, but never attempted to:
1. State a concrete hypothesis about the transformation
2. Write code to implement a candidate transformation
3. Test the hypothesis against training examples
4. Iterate on failures

### Analysis Paralysis Indicators

From the reasoning traces:

**iter 3:** "Output order: TL(4), BR(6), TR(7), BL(10) — sorted by count ascending!"
Then immediately doubts itself: "But Train 1 output reverses... Maybe secondary sort by color?"

**iter 4:** "Or maybe it's sorted by count: 4 < 6 < 7 < 10 → 2, 3, 4, 1. Yes sorted ascending by count!"
Then: "Maybe secondary sort by color? 9 > 8 > 2... no that's descending by color"
Then: "What if it's the area of the bounding box of the shape?"

**iter 5:** "So the blocks are NOT transposed individually - they stay the same. Only the arrangement changes."
Correctly observes blocks don't transpose, but then goes to compute more metrics.

**iter 7:** "So maybe the rule is simply: Transpose the layout... But when converting from one to the other, something happens"
Then: "Let me reconsider. Maybe it IS just transposing the layout."
Then: "Hmm. Let me reconsider. Maybe it's not about sorting at all."

The agent cycled through multiple theories (sorting by count, sorting by bounding box area, transposing layout, diagonal reading patterns) but never committed to testing any single theory.

### What the Agent Missed

The actual transformation is visible in the training data:
- Train 0: 2x2 grid (11x11) → vertical stack (23x5) with blocks reordered
- Train 1: vertical stack (17x5) → horizontal row (5x17) with blocks reversed
- Train 2: horizontal row (5x17) → vertical stack (17x5) with same order

The agent correctly identified these layout changes but got stuck trying to find a universal sorting rule instead of recognizing that the rule might vary by configuration.

## Root Cause

**Primary failure:** Analysis paralysis — computed features exhaustively without ever attempting to synthesize and test a solution.

**Contributing factors:**
1. **No hypothesize-and-test cycle:** The agent never wrote code to implement a candidate transformation and check it against training examples
2. **Metric obsession:** Kept computing new metrics (count, bbox, perimeter) hoping to find the "obvious" pattern
3. **Overthinking:** The transformation is moderately complex (different rules for different layout types), but the agent got stuck looking for a single universal rule
4. **No delegation:** Could have used `llm()` to describe the visual pattern or `rlm()` to brute-force test different arrangements
5. **No incremental progress:** Never wrote partial solution code that could be refined

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Hypothesis-testing methodology:** After iter 2-3, agent should have:
   - Stated hypothesis: "Train 0 sorts blocks by count ascending"
   - Written code to implement this transformation
   - Tested on Train 0 output
   - Debugged discrepancies on Train 1/2

2. **Time-boxing exploration:** Should have moved to implementation by iter 4-5 at latest

3. **Visual pattern delegation:** Could have used `llm()` with grid visualizations:
   ```javascript
   const pattern = await llm(`
     Look at these input→output grid pairs and describe the transformation rule:
     [paste formatted grids]
   `);
   ```

4. **Brute-force search:** For a finite problem (arranging N blocks), could enumerate possibilities:
   ```javascript
   // Try all permutations of blocks, check which matches output
   for (let perm of permutations(blocks)) {
     if (matches(perm, expectedOutput)) return perm;
   }
   ```

5. **Meta-reasoning checkpoint:** After computing 3+ different metrics without progress, should have:
   - Recognized the pattern of diminishing returns
   - Explicitly shifted strategy from "analyze more" to "test something"
   - Set a forcing function: "By iter N, I will have attempted at least one full transformation"

## Behavioral Patterns

**exploration-heavy:** 100% of iterations spent exploring, 0% implementing or testing
**pattern-search-via-metrics:** Computed count, bbox, perimeter, position hoping to find sorting key
**exhaustive-feature-computation:** Extracted every measurable property without clear theory
**overthinking-transformation:** Cycled through 5+ different theories without testing any
**incremental-complexity:** Started with simple theories (count), added complexity (bbox, perimeter) when those failed
**no-hypothesize-and-test:** Never committed to a concrete implementation to validate

## Success Factors (if score == 1.0)

N/A — task timed out with score 0.

## Technical Notes

- **Context size:** ARC tasks have small context (3 training examples), so context wasn't the limiting factor
- **Transformation complexity:** The actual rule involves multiple cases (2x2→column, column→row, row→column) with different orderings per case
- **Abort reason:** System aborted operation after 391 seconds without return
- **Iterations budget:** Used 9 of presumed 20 iterations, but all on analysis

## Quotes from Trace

**iter 3 reasoning:**
> "So input order: TL(3,2) TR(5,4) BL(9,1) BR(5,3)"
> "Output order: o1=? o2=? o3=? o4=?"
> "Sorting by count ascending: TL(3) -> BR(5),TR(5) -> BL(9)"

**iter 4 reasoning:**
> "Let me analyze the ordering pattern:"
> "Train 0: TL(4,2) TR(7,4) BL(10,1) BR(6,3) → output: (4,2) (6,3) (7,4) (10,1) — sorted by count ascending!"
> "Train 1: b1(7,8) b2(7,2) b3(7,9) → output: (7,9) (7,2) (7,8) — all same count... reversed order?"

**iter 6 reasoning:**
> "So the blocks are NOT transposed individually - they stay the same. Only the arrangement changes."

**iter 7 reasoning:**
> "Hmm. So when going from column to row, reverse. When going from row to column, keep."
> "But Train 0 is 2x2 to column, which is a different transformation."

**iter 8 reasoning (near end):**
> "Perimeters: TL=10, TR=16, BL=14, BR=14. Output order: TL, BR, TR, BL → 10, 14, 16, 14. Not sorted."
> "Let me try a completely different approach. Maybe the transformation is just about transposing the grid of blocks..."

The agent correctly computed features and made accurate observations, but never synthesized them into a testable solution.
