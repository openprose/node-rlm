# Trajectory: arc-136b0064

## Task Summary

ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) grid transformation task requiring pattern discovery from 3 training examples to solve a test case. Input grids are 15 columns wide with blocks of 3x6 patterns in the left section (cols 0-5), a separator column (col 6) with encoded values, a column of 4s (col 7), and a right section (cols 8-14) that is mostly zeros with one cell containing a 5 marking a position. Output grids are 7 columns wide, same height as input, and contain a snake-like path drawing pattern.

Expected: Snake path starting from a specific column. Got: Snake path starting from wrong column, resulting in complete mismatch. Score: 0.0.

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Systematic Exploration (iter 1-10, 50% of trajectory)
**Strategy:** Comprehensive structural analysis of input format and output patterns

**Observations made:**
- Input structure: 15 cols = left blocks (0-5) + separator col (6) + col of 4s (7) + right section (8-14)
- Each block is 3 rows × 6 cols, divided into two 3×3 halves with different colors
- Output is 7 cols wide, contains colored segments forming a snake path
- Special value 5 appears in right section, marks a position
- Column 6 contains values matching right-half colors of blocks

**Code evidence from iter 4:**
```javascript
// Found the special value positions:
// Train 0: Special value 5 at (0, 9)  -> output col 1 (9-8=1)
// Train 1: Special value 5 at (0, 11) -> output col 3 (11-8=3)
// Train 2: Special value 5 at (0, 12) -> output col 4 (12-8=4)
```

**Assessment:** Strong structural understanding. The RLM correctly identified:
- The 5 marks the starting column for the output snake
- Output column = input column - 8
- Blocks are separated by zero rows
- Each block has left and right 3×3 sections with different colors

However, the exploration phase took too long (10 iterations, 50% of budget), leaving insufficient time for hypothesis testing and refinement.

### Phase 2: Pattern Hypothesis Attempts (iter 11-15, 25% of trajectory)
**Strategy:** Try multiple approaches to map blocks to output segments

**Attempted mappings:**
1. **Left shape → Horizontal segment, Right shape → Vertical segment** (iter 11-12)
   - Failed because colors didn't match in sequential order

2. **Shape count → Segment length** (iter 13-14)
   - Tried mapping cell counts (5, 7, 4, 3) to segment lengths
   - Failed because counts appeared in multiple contexts with different meanings

3. **Column 6 values encode connections** (iter 12)
   - Noticed col6 values match right-half colors
   - Failed to decode how they connect blocks to segments

**Evidence from iter 13:**
```javascript
// Attempted shape-to-direction mapping:
// Shape "110|101|010" (cnt=5) -> points DOWN?
// Shape "101|101|111" (cnt=7) -> open at top, filled bottom -> points DOWN?
// Shape "101|010|010" (cnt=4) -> points DOWN from top
```

**Assessment:** The RLM recognized the task required mapping block shapes to snake segments but couldn't crack the encoding. Multiple hypotheses were abandoned without systematic validation. Key issue: no manual trace of a single training example to verify any hypothesis end-to-end.

### Phase 3: Deadline Panic (iter 16-18, 15% of trajectory)
**Strategy:** Shift from systematic exploration to manual construction under time pressure

**Reasoning from iter 16:**
```
Status: DEADLINE APPROACHING - need to figure this out fast
"The 5's input column minus 8 gives the output column."
"Let me try a completely different approach - maybe I should delegate this
to an intelligent model."
```

**Reasoning from iter 17:**
```
Status: DEADLINE MODE - need to produce answer NOW
"The intelligent pattern recognition is taking too long. Let me try to
manually construct based on what I see."
```

**Assessment:** Under deadline pressure, the RLM abandoned systematic pattern discovery and switched to manual construction. No delegation actually occurred despite consideration. This time pressure led to guessing rather than validation.

### Phase 4: Manual Construction & Return (iter 19-20, 10% of trajectory)
**Strategy:** Manually construct output grid based on incomplete understanding, then return

**From iter 19 reasoning:**
```javascript
// "Let me construct the output based on the patterns I've identified."
// Attempted mappings:
// - Left `110/101/010` (cnt=5) → H RIGHT 3 cells
// - Left `101/101/111` (cnt=7) → H LEFT 2 cells
// - Left `101/010/010` (cnt=4) → V DOWN (length from right shape)
// But: "The counts don't match... Let me try direct mapping..."
```

**Critical error:** The RLM placed the starting 5 at output column 3 (test input has 5 at col 11, so 11-8=3). However, examining the answer vs expected:
- Answer: `[[0,0,0,5,0,0,0],...]` - 5 at column 3
- Expected: `[[0,0,5,0,0,0,0],...]` - 5 at column 2

The starting position was wrong, cascading into completely wrong segment placements throughout the grid.

**Assessment:** Under extreme time pressure, the RLM constructed a plausible-looking snake pattern but with incorrect starting position and segment mappings. No verification was performed before return.

## Root Cause

**Primary failure mode: wrong-pattern-hypothesis**

The RLM never successfully decoded the mapping from input blocks to output snake segments. Contributing factors:

1. **Insufficient time for hypothesis validation**
   - Spent 50% of iterations on exploration without attempting full solution implementation
   - Never implemented a `solve()` function to test against all training examples
   - No manual end-to-end trace of even one training example

2. **Multiple competing hypotheses without elimination**
   - Tried at least 3 different block→segment mappings (iter 11-15)
   - Abandoned each hypothesis when initial attempt failed, without systematic debugging
   - Never committed to one hypothesis and debugged it thoroughly

3. **Deadline pressure leading to premature return**
   - Final 5 iterations (iter 16-20) dominated by time anxiety
   - Switched from systematic validation to manual construction
   - Returned an unverified answer

4. **Off-by-one error in starting position**
   - The formula "output col = input col - 8" was correct
   - But the test input had 5 at column 10 (not 11 as the RLM used in iter 19)
   - This suggests the RLM may have miscounted or misread the test input in the final rush

**Evidence the pattern was solvable:**
The training examples showed consistent structure (3 examples, all with same input format). A systematic approach like the successful arc-db695cfb trajectory would have worked:
1. Manually trace Train 0 from input blocks to output segments (identify mapping rules)
2. Verify rules produce correct output for Train 0
3. Test rules on Train 1 and Train 2
4. Apply to test case

This trajectory never completed step 1.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Earlier hypothesis commitment with systematic validation**
   - By iter 8-10, the RLM had identified the core structure (blocks, snake path, 5 marking start)
   - Should have picked one block→segment mapping hypothesis and manually traced it through Train 0
   - Code up a `solve()` function by iter 12-13, leaving 7-8 iterations for debugging

2. **Manual trace visualization**
   - The successful trajectory (arc-db695cfb) used explicit manual traces:
     ```javascript
     // Expected perpendicular lines for Train 0:
     // From 6@(5,3), perpendicular direction is (-1,+1) and (+1,-1):
     // Expected: [[4,4],[3,5],[2,6],[1,7],[0,8],[6,2],[7,1],[8,0]]
     ```
   - This trajectory attempted similar analysis but never completed a full trace

3. **Verification before return**
   - Even with 1 iteration remaining, the RLM could have logged the constructed answer and visually compared it to expected format
   - A quick check would have revealed the starting position was wrong

4. **Plugin: arc-pattern-analyzer** (hypothetical)
   - Could provide structured prompts for ARC tasks: "Manually trace Train 0 input→output step by step"
   - Force systematic validation before allowing return

5. **Better deadline management**
   - Reserve last 5-7 iterations for solution implementation and validation
   - If no hypothesis by iter 13-14, explicitly declare "pivot to manual construction mode"
   - Don't let deadline pressure eliminate validation step

## Behavioral Notes

**Anti-patterns observed:**

1. **Exploration paralysis** (iter 1-10)
   - Kept gathering data without attempting synthesis
   - Each iteration revealed more structure but never committed to a testable hypothesis

2. **Hypothesis shopping without validation** (iter 11-15)
   - Multiple rapid hypothesis attempts
   - Abandoned each at first sign of difficulty
   - Never implemented any hypothesis as code to systematically test

3. **Deadline-driven premature return** (iter 16-20)
   - Time pressure eliminated critical thinking
   - Manual construction replaced systematic problem-solving
   - Returned first plausible-looking answer without verification

4. **No delegation despite consideration** (iter 16)
   - RLM noted "maybe I should delegate this to an intelligent model"
   - Never actually used `llm()` or `rlm()` for sub-problems
   - Could have delegated: "Given this block pattern [data], what snake segment would it produce?"

**Comparison to successful ARC trajectory (arc-db695cfb):**

| Aspect | arc-db695cfb (score=1.0) | arc-136b0064 (score=0.0) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Exploration phase | 4 iters (57%) | 10 iters (50%) |
| Hypothesis validation | Manual trace in iter 5 | None - abandoned multiple hypotheses |
| Solution implementation | Full `solve()` function iter 6 | Manual construction iter 19 |
| Training validation | 5/5 MATCH before test | Never validated any training example |
| Verification before return | Implicit (5/5 train pass) | None |
| Final answer quality | Perfect match | Complete mismatch |

The key difference: arc-db695cfb committed to a hypothesis early (iter 5), validated it manually, then tested systematically. This trajectory explored too long, hypothesized too shallowly, and returned too hastily.

## Technical Deep Dive: The Actual Pattern (Post-Mortem)

Based on the expected output, the actual transformation appears to be:

**Rule (inferred from answer/expected comparison):**
1. Find the 5 in the input (cols 8-14) - this marks the starting column for the snake
2. Starting column = (5's column) - 8
3. Each block in the input encodes snake segments (horizontal and/or vertical)
4. Blocks are processed in order, drawing the snake path downward through the output grid
5. Each block's left 3×3 and right 3×3 patterns encode segment direction and length

**Why the RLM failed:**
The encoding from block patterns to segment properties was complex (likely involving shape orientation, cell counts, and column 6 values simultaneously). Without implementing and testing a hypothesis systematically against training data, the RLM couldn't discover the multi-factor encoding scheme.

**The test case:**
- Input: 5 blocks, 5 at input column 10
- Expected output starting column: 10 - 8 = 2
- RLM's output starting column: 3 (off by 1, suggesting miscounted or used wrong column)

This starting position error propagated through all subsequent segments, resulting in zero score despite reasonable understanding of the overall task structure.

## Verdict Analysis

**Score: 0.0** - Complete mismatch, though the output format and structure were correct (19×7 grid with colored segments and a 5 marker).

**Why zero and not partial credit:**
- ARC tasks are evaluated on exact grid match
- Even one cell wrong = full failure
- The snake pattern was in wrong columns throughout entire grid
- No cell-level partial credit in ARC scoring

**How close was the RLM:**
- Understood the task structure (blocks → snake segments)
- Identified the 5 marker's role
- Recognized the output width calculation
- But failed on the precise encoding rules, making the answer completely wrong despite conceptual proximity
