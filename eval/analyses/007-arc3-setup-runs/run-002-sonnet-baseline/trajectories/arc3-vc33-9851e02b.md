# Trajectory: arc3-vc33-9851e02b

## Task Summary

ARC-AGI-3 click puzzle game "vc33". 64x64 grid with click-only interaction (action 6).
The model successfully understood the game mechanics: clicking colored elements (diamonds/dots)
fills a progress bar in row 0. It progressed from 0/64 to ~56/64 filled in the progress bar.
However, it used 50 actions (the game's action limit) without completing level 1, which has
a human baseline of 6 actions. The model was clicking individual pixels rather than understanding
the underlying puzzle pattern. Score: 0. Levels completed: 0/7.

## Control Flow

```
iter  0  EXPLORE:data-probe            →  call arc3.start(), inspect metadata (1x64 frame, available_actions=6)
iter  1  EXPLORE:structure             →  examine frame[0] structure, discover each element is a 64-value row array
iter  2  EXPLORE:visualize             ✓  render full 64x64 grid with symbols, identify game elements
iter  3  EXPLORE:visualize             →  locate interactive objects: color-9 diamonds, color-11 dots, color-4 blocks
iter  4  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H1]  ✗  click dot at (38,28) — no visible change
iter  5  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H2]  ✓  click dot at (50,44) — top bar changes: (61,0) and (62,0) flip 7->4
iter  6  EXTRACT:apply           [H2]  ✓  click diamond at (60,24) — massive grid reorganization + bar fills more
iter  7  EXTRACT:apply           [H2]  →  click 3 more diamond positions — bar grows to 8/64 filled
iter  8  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  click lower diamonds and horizontal bar dots — bar at 15/64
iter  9  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  click remaining dot at (39,28) — bar at 15/64
iter 10  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  find and click all remaining color-11 dots (20 dots) — bar at 37/64
iter 11  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  find all remaining clickables (110 elements) — bar reaches ~56/64, GAME_OVER at 50 actions
iter 12  RETURN                        ✓  detect game completed, get scorecard, return JSON
```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Clicking color-11 dots on horizontal bar triggers progress | 4 | rejected | Click at (38,28) produced no visible change |
| H2 | Clicking interactive elements fills top progress bar | 5-7 | **accepted** | Click at (50,44) changed top bar; diamond click at (60,24) caused massive restructuring |
| H3 | Click ALL colored elements to fill the bar to 64/64 | 8-11 | **accepted** (but insufficient) | Systematic clicking filled bar progressively but hit 50-action limit |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1(ineffective click target) -> H2(breakthrough: elements affect top bar) -> H3(brute-force all elements)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Frame Understanding (iter 0-1)

**Strategy:** Standard frame probing.
**Result:** Identified `1x64` frame where each element is a 64-value array. Took 2 iterations.

Iter 0 output:
```
Game ID: vc33-9851e02b
Available actions: 6
Frame dimensions: 1 x 64
```

The model recognized `available_actions: 6` means click-only (action 6 with coordinates).

### Phase 2: Grid Visualization (iter 2-3)

**Strategy:** Render the full grid and catalog all game elements.
**Effectiveness:** Excellent. Iter 2 produced a full symbolic map:

```
Row 0:  ================================================================  (all 7s — progress bar, unfilled)
Rows 1-27:  Mostly spaces (3) and dots (0), with a band of 5-blocks and 11-dots
Rows 28-31: ██████████████████●●████████████████████████  (horizontal bar with dots)
Rows 32-63: Diamonds (9), blocks (4), dots (11) in right half
```

Iter 3 cataloged all positions:
- 32 pixels of color 9 (diamonds) in two 4x4 blocks at (60,24-27) and (60,32-35)
- 20 pixels of color 11 (dots) at (38-39,28-31) and scattered (44-51,44-49)
- 16 pixels of color 4 (blocks) at (46-49,44-49) — a cross shape
- Color 5 (filled blocks) in a horizontal band at rows 28-31

### Phase 3: Discovery of Click Mechanic (iter 4-6)

**Iter 4 — first click attempt:** Click at (38,28) on a color-11 dot.
```
After click:
State: NOT_FINISHED
```
No visible change detected. The model noted this as a failed attempt.

**Iter 5 — breakthrough:** Click at (50,44) on a different color-11 dot.
```
Detected changes:
  (61, 0): 7 -> 4
  (62, 0): 7 -> 4
Total changes: 2
```
Two pixels in the top bar (row 0) changed from 7 (unfilled) to 4 (filled). This established
the core mechanic: clicking interactive elements fills the progress bar.

**Iter 6 — diamond click:** Click at (60,24) on a color-9 diamond.
```
Detected changes: [massive list]
  (60, 0): 7 -> 4          # bar fills one more
  (28, 1-27): 3 -> 0       # column opened up
  (52, 32-63): 0 -> 3      # column filled
  (48-51, 44-49): shifted   # bottom shape moved right
```
Clicking the diamond caused a major grid restructuring: a column was cleared, the bottom
interactive shape shifted right, and the progress bar advanced.

### Phase 4: Brute-Force Clicking (iter 7-11)

Once the mechanic was understood, the model entered a brute-force phase:

**Iter 7:** Clicked 3 more positions around the diamonds. Bar reached 8/64.
**Iter 8:** Clicked lower diamonds and dots. Bar at 15/64.
**Iter 9:** Clicked dot at (39,28). Bar still at 15/64.
**Iter 10:** Programmatic loop to find and click all 20 remaining color-11 dots:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < allDots.length && currentFrame.levels_completed === 0; i++) {
  const dot = allDots[i];
  currentFrame = await arc3.step(6, dot.x, dot.y);
}
```
After 33 actions: bar at 37/64.

**Iter 11:** Found 110 remaining clickable elements (dots + blocks + diamonds) and looped:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < clickables.length && frame.levels_completed === 0; i++) {
  frame = await arc3.step(6, elem.x, elem.y);
}
```
Reached 56/64 filled at action 44, then `"Game already completed"` error at action 50.

**Key insight from the scorecard:**
```json
"level_baseline_actions": [6, 13, 31, 59, 92, 24, 82]
```
Human level 1 baseline: **6 actions**. Model used **50 actions**. The model was
clicking pixel-by-pixel when the puzzle likely has a higher-level solution (e.g.,
click the center of each interactive region, not every pixel).

### Phase 5: Return (iter 12)

The model detected `arc3.completed: true` and `state: GAME_OVER`, retrieved the
scorecard via `arc3.getScore()`, and returned the JSON. This was the only game
where the model successfully called `return()`.

## Root Cause

**Brute-force pixel clicking instead of understanding puzzle semantics.**

The human baseline of 6 actions for level 1 suggests the correct approach is to click
approximately 6 specific targets (likely the center of each interactive region or a
specific sequence of clicks). The model instead discovered that *any* click on a colored
element advances the progress bar, and proceeded to click every pixel individually.

The math: with 64 bar positions to fill and each click filling ~1-2 positions, brute-force
requires ~32-64 clicks. But the 50-action limit makes this impossible. The human baseline
of 6 suggests each "correct" click fills ~10 bar positions.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Click clustering** -- Instead of clicking every pixel, click the center of each
   distinct colored region. The 4x4 diamond block at (60,24-27) likely counts as one
   target, not 16 individual pixels.
2. **Efficiency analysis after first clicks** -- After discovering that clicking (50,44)
   filled 2 bar positions and clicking (60,24) filled 1 plus restructured the grid, the
   model should have analyzed *which* clicks are most efficient rather than brute-forcing.
3. **Action budget awareness** -- The model never checked how many actions it had remaining
   or what the action limit was. With 50 actions for 7 levels, it should have targeted
   ~7 actions per level, not 50 on level 1.
4. **Pattern recognition** -- The grid restructuring after clicking (60,24) suggests
   clicking diamonds triggers a "cascade" effect. The model should have investigated
   whether clicking the *center* of each region triggers the cascade more efficiently.
5. **More iterations** -- Even with brute-force, the model might have completed level 1
   with more iterations to find and click the remaining elements. But the 50-action
   GAME_OVER limit is the real constraint, not iterations.
