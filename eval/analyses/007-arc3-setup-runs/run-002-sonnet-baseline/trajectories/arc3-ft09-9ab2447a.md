# Trajectory: arc3-ft09-9ab2447a

## Task Summary

ARC-AGI-3 pattern-matching puzzle game "ft09". 64x64 grid with 6 available actions
(1-4 directional, 5 interact, 6 click). The grid shows three example blocks on the
left (rows 2-23) with colored triplets (left-pattern-right), and a large framed target
area on the right (rows 32-61) containing a query pattern. Row 63 has an alternating
1-2 cursor pattern that expands as the player takes actions.

The model correctly parsed the puzzle layout and identified the pattern-matching
structure but could never discover how to submit an answer. Clicks on examples, the
target area, and the frame border all produced zero visible changes. 26 actions used,
0 levels completed. Score: 0.

## Control Flow

```
iter  0  EXPLORE:data-probe            →  call arc3.start(), inspect metadata (1x64, actions=1-6, 6 levels)
iter  1  ERROR:runtime                 ✗  attempt row-major frame access — TypeError (same 1x64 issue)
iter  2  EXPLORE:structure             ✓  confirm column-major format, visualize as 64x64 grid
iter  3  EXPLORE:visualize             ✓  render full grid, identify puzzle structure (examples + framed target)
iter  4  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H1]  →  try action 5 (interact) — only row 63 changes (cursor extends)
iter  5  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H1]  →  try action 4 (right) — only row 63 changes
iter  6  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H1]  →  try actions 3 (left) + 1 (up) — only row 63 changes
iter  7  EXPLORE:hyp-form              ✓  analyze puzzle: 3 examples with [left_color]-[pattern]-[right_color]
iter  8  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H2]  →  detailed pattern comparison: Ex2 pattern != query pattern
iter  9  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H3]  ✗  click on Example 1 area (14,5) — zero change
iter 10  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H3]  ✗  click on query pattern (47,47) — zero change
iter 11  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H4]  ✗  click Example 1 left block, Example 2 middle, frame border — zero change
iter 12  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H5]  ✗  navigate cursor left 10x, then interact — only row 63 changes
iter 13  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H5]  ✗  systematic clicks on Example 2 middle, right block, frame border — zero change
iter 14  STALL                         ✗  hit max iterations with no successful interaction
```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Directional actions and interact move cursor or trigger mechanic | 4-6 | rejected | Only row 63 (cursor bar) changes; no effect on puzzle grid |
| H2 | Query pattern matches one of the examples; identify which | 7-8 | inconclusive | Query `002222/008800/002222` differs from Ex2 `220022/008822/220000`; analysis incomplete |
| H3 | Clicking on example blocks selects the answer | 9-10 | rejected | Clicks at (14,5), (47,47) produce zero grid changes |
| H4 | Clicking on specific regions (left block, right block, frame) submits answer | 11 | rejected | Clicks at (7,4), (23,12), (48,32) produce zero changes |
| H5 | Row 63 cursor must be positioned correctly before interact | 12-13 | rejected | Extensive left movement + interact produced no changes besides row 63 |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1(cursor) -> H2(pattern analysis) -> H3(click example) -> H4(click regions) -> H5(cursor positioning)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Frame Parsing (iter 0-2)

**Strategy:** Standard frame probing.
**Result:** Same `1x64` column-major format confusion. Iter 1 hit `TypeError` trying
row-major access. Iter 2 correctly parsed it.

Iter 2 rendered the full grid showing a distinctive pattern:
```
00: ................................................................
02: ....999999..888888..999999............999999..888888..999999....
10: ....888888..220022..999999............888888..220022..888888....
18: ....999999..888888..888888............999999..888888..999999....
32: ................................222222444444444444444444222222..
44: ....888888..002222..888888......444499999944002222449999994444..
63: 1212121212121212121212121212121212121212121212121212121212121212..
```

**Wasted iterations:** 1 (iter 1 — TypeError)

### Phase 2: Puzzle Structure Analysis (iter 3, 7-8)

The model identified a clear puzzle structure:

**Left side — three example rows (rows 2-23):**
- Example 1 (rows 2-7): `999999..888888..999999` — triplet 9-8-9
- Example 2 (rows 10-15): `888888..[pattern]..999999` — triplet 8-pattern-9
- Example 3 (rows 18-23): `999999..888888..888888` — triplet 9-8-8

**Right side — framed target (rows 32-61):**
- A bordered region with `2s` and `4s` forming the frame
- Inside: `999999` blocks flanking a query pattern
- Query pattern (rows 44-49, cols 44-49): `002222/002222/008800/008800/002222/002222`

**Right side mirrors left side** — each example on the left has a corresponding row
on the right within the framed area.

**Pattern analysis (iter 8):**
```
Example 2 middle:  220022 / 220022 / 008822 / 008822 / 220000 / 220000
Query pattern:     002222 / 002222 / 008800 / 008800 / 002222 / 002222
```
The patterns are similar but not identical. The model noticed this mismatch but
did not pursue the analysis further (e.g., checking if the query is a transformation
of one of the examples).

### Phase 3: Interaction Attempts (iter 4-6, 9-13)

**Iter 4-6 (movement/interact):**
All directional actions and interact only affected row 63:
```
Before: ...1212121212
After:  ...1212121111  (1s extend leftward)
```
After 5 up movements: `...111111111111111111111111111111111111`
The 1-region grew to consume most of the right side of row 63.

**Iter 9-10 (clicking examples and target):**
```javascript
const frame5 = await arc3.step(6, 14, 5);  // Click Example 1 — no change
const frame6 = await arc3.step(6, 47, 47); // Click query pattern — no change
```

**Iter 11 (systematic region clicking):**
```javascript
arc3.step(6, 7, 4);   // Example 1 left block — no change
arc3.step(6, 23, 12);  // Example 2 right block — no change
arc3.step(6, 48, 32);  // Frame border — no change
```

**Iter 12-13 (cursor positioning + interact):**
The model tried moving the cursor left 10 positions, then interacting.
No changes besides row 63.

**Assessment:** The model exhaustively tried clicking on every logical target area
and using every available action type. Nothing produced visible changes to the
puzzle grid. This suggests the game mechanic is fundamentally different from what
the model assumed.

### Phase 4: Stall (iter 14)

The model was about to try more systematic clicking but hit max iterations.

## Root Cause

**The game's interaction mechanic is completely opaque to the model.**

The model correctly identified the puzzle *content* (pattern matching with examples)
but never discovered *how to submit an answer*. Key observations:

1. **Row 63 cursor is the only feedback channel** -- Every action (movement, interact,
   click) affects row 63 but nothing else. The cursor grows from right to left.
2. **The cursor likely IS the answer mechanism** -- The alternating 1-2 pattern in
   row 63 may encode a selection. Moving changes which positions are "selected" (value 1
   vs value 2). The model should have investigated what the cursor state encodes.
3. **26 actions with zero grid changes** -- Despite extensive clicking, the puzzle
   grid never changed. This strongly suggests clicks are not the mechanism.

Possible actual mechanic: The row 63 cursor may represent a binary selection (1=selected,
2=unselected) that the model must configure to encode the answer, then submit with
interact. The model never tested this theory.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Cursor semantics investigation** -- The model should have mapped out exactly how
   each action affects row 63. Does up/down cycle through values? Does left/right move
   a position? Does interact submit the current row 63 state?
2. **Action encoding documentation** -- The `arc3-player` app should document what
   each action does per game type, or at minimum provide hints.
3. **More iterations** -- 15 iterations is insufficient for a game where the first 3
   are spent on frame parsing and the interaction mechanic requires extensive exploration.
4. **Systematic action logging** -- The model should have created a helper function to
   log the exact state of row 63 after each action, building a model of the cursor
   behavior.
5. **Pattern-matching reasoning** -- Even without understanding the submission mechanic,
   the model should have completed the pattern analysis. The query pattern's relationship
   to the examples was never fully resolved. If the answer is "Example 2" or a specific
   color, knowing that would have narrowed the submission strategy.
6. **Prior game knowledge** -- Access to documentation about how ft09 works, or
   experience from prior runs of the same game, would have immediately revealed the
   cursor mechanic.
