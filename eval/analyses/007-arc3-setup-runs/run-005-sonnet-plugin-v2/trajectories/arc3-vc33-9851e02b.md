# Trajectory: arc3-vc33-9851e02b

## Task Summary

ARC-AGI-3 click puzzle game "vc33". 64x64 grid with click-only interaction (action 6).
The model correctly parsed the frame on iter 0 (no frame errors -- plugin fix worked),
identified interactive colored elements (color-9 maroon, color-11 cyan, color-4 yellow),
and discovered that clicking them fills a progress bar (row 0) from color 7 (orange)
to color 4 (yellow). It then brute-force-clicked each element individually, filling
60/64 of the progress bar before hitting the 50-action GAME_OVER limit on level 1.
Human baseline for level 1 is 6 actions. Score: 0. Levels completed: 0/7.

## Control Flow

```
iter  0  EXPLORE:data-probe            →  call arc3.start(), inspect metadata; correctly accesses frame.frame[0] as 64x64 grid
iter  1  EXPLORE:visualize             →  render grid rows 0-15 cols 0-15; sees color 7 at row 0, color 3 filling rows 1-15
iter  2  EXPLORE:structure             →  color distribution: 0=1216, 3=2580, 4=16, 5=168, 7=64, 9=32, 11=20; render rows 0-30
iter  3  EXPLORE:structure             →  locate objects by color: 4@rows44-49, 5@rows28-31, 7@row0, 9@rows24-35, 11@rows28-49
iter  4  EXPLORE:visualize             →  render rows 20-55 cols 35-64; identifies diamond (9), bar (5), dot (11), yellow (4) shapes
iter  5  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H1]  ✗  click yellow object at (47,46) — 0 pixels changed
iter  6  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H2]  ✓  click cyan bar at (38,30) — color 4 increased 16->19, color 7 decreased 64->61; 3 pixels changed at top row
iter  7  EXPLORE:visualize       [H2]  ✓  check top row: see "7 7...7 7 7 4 4 4" at cols 61-63; clicking cyan filled 3 progress pixels
iter  8  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H3]  ✓  click maroon block at (61,26) — 1 more pixel converted: color 4=20, color 7=60
iter  9  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  click 4 more elements (cyan lower, maroon lower, cyan upper, maroon upper) — 9/64 yellow
iter 10  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  ~  for-loop clicking 55 alternating cyan/maroon targets; 22/64 -> 35/64 -> 47/64 -> 60/64, then GAME_OVER at action 50
iter 11  RETURN                        ✓  detect GAME_OVER, get scorecard, return JSON with score=0
```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Click yellow (color 4) object to interact | 5 | rejected | 0 pixels changed |
| H2 | Click cyan (color 11) bars to fill progress bar | 6-7 | accepted | 3 pixels of row-0 converted orange->yellow per click |
| H3 | Click any colored element (cyan + maroon) to fill bar | 8-10 | accepted | each click converts ~1 orange pixel to yellow |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1(rejected) -> H2(discovered mechanic) -> H3(generalized to all colored elements)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Frame Parsing and Structure Discovery (iter 0-4)

**Strategy:** Standard data probing with `frame.frame[0]` indexing.
**Effectiveness:** The model correctly accessed the 64x64 grid from iter 0 with no TypeError errors. This is a direct improvement from the updated plugin documentation. Color distribution analysis identified all 7 distinct colors and their bounding boxes by iter 3. By iter 4, the full spatial layout was mapped:
- Row 0: orange (7) progress bar
- Rows 1-27: green (3) background + black (0) empty space
- Rows 28-31: gray (5) horizontal bar with cyan (11) insertions
- Rows 24-35, cols 60-63: maroon (9) diamond blocks
- Rows 44-49, cols 46-49: yellow (4) cross shape with cyan (11) column

**Wasted iterations:** 0 (contrast with run-002's 3-4 iterations on frame parsing errors).

### Phase 2: Mechanic Discovery (iter 5-8)

**Strategy:** Systematic clicking of each color to discover interactive elements.
**Key moment:** Iter 6 click on cyan bar at (38,30) produced the breakthrough -- the progress bar at row 0 showed 3 orange pixels converting to yellow. Iter 8 confirmed maroon blocks have the same effect (1 pixel per click).
**Efficiency issue:** The model noted each click converts ~1 pixel but didn't investigate whether there's a more efficient interaction (the human baseline of 6 actions for level 1 implies there is a bulk or pattern-based mechanic).

### Phase 3: Brute-Force Execution (iter 9-10)

**Strategy:** Alternate clicking between cyan and maroon elements in a loop.
**Code pattern (iter 10):**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 55; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    frame = await arc3.step(6, 38, 30);  // cyan bar
  } else {
    frame = await arc3.step(6, 61, 26);  // maroon block
  }
  // ... check every 10 clicks ...
}
```
**Result:** Progress bar filled from 9/64 to 60/64 yellow across 43 actions in iter 10 alone. The action loop guidance from the plugin worked -- the model took 43 actions in a single iteration rather than 1 per iteration. However, this also accelerated hitting the 50-action GAME_OVER limit.
**Actions at GAME_OVER:** 50 total (1 in iter 5 + 1 in iter 6 + 1 in iter 8 + 4 in iter 9 + 43 in iter 10).

### Phase 4: Return (iter 11)

**Decision:** Detected GAME_OVER via the error "Game already completed" thrown from iter 10's loop. Called `arc3.getScore()` and returned the scorecard JSON.
**Score:** 0 -- despite filling 60/64 of the progress bar, level 1 was not completed. 50 actions used vs 6-action human baseline.

## Root Cause

The model discovered a low-level interaction mechanic (click individual colored elements to advance a progress bar) but failed to discover the high-level puzzle logic. The human baseline of 6 actions for level 1 implies there's a pattern-based or combinatorial solution -- likely clicking specific elements in a specific order or discovering a "select all" mechanic. The model's brute-force approach of clicking each element individually exhausted the 50-action limit before completing even level 1.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Puzzle analysis before brute-force** -- After discovering clicking advances the bar, the model should have experimented with different click targets to find which ones have the most effect (e.g., does clicking the yellow cross do something special? Does click order matter?).
2. **Action budget awareness** -- The model should have tracked actions vs the human baseline (6 for level 1) and realized brute-force clicking would overshoot the budget.
3. **Pattern recognition** -- The spatial layout (diamond + cross + bar + dots) suggests a symbolic puzzle. The model should have analyzed what the shapes represent before clicking.

## Comparison to Run 002

- **Frame parsing:** Improved. Zero frame errors (vs 2-3 iterations lost in run-002).
- **Mechanic discovery:** Similar. Both runs discovered the click-to-fill-bar mechanic around iter 5-6.
- **Execution:** Run-005 used the action loop pattern (43 actions in one iteration) vs run-002's more spread-out clicking. Both hit the 50-action limit at the same stage.
- **Progress bar fill:** Run-005 reached 60/64 (run-002 reached ~56/64). Slightly more progress due to fewer wasted iterations.
- **Outcome:** Identical -- 0/7 levels, score 0.
