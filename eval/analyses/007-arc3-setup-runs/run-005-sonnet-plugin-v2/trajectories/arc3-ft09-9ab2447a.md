# Trajectory: arc3-ft09-9ab2447a

## Task Summary

ARC-AGI-3 pattern-matching puzzle game "ft09". 64x64 grid with 6 available actions
(1-4 directional, 5 interact, 6 click). The grid shows colored rectangular blocks on a
gray (color 5) background, with a special pattern region at rows 10-15, cols 12-17
containing a 6x6 grid of colors 0, 2, and 8. Row 63 has a cursor bar (colors 11/12)
that expands leftward as the player takes actions.

The model correctly parsed the frame (no TypeError errors -- plugin fix worked),
identified the puzzle structure, discovered the row-63 cursor mechanic, but never
figured out how to submit an answer or interact with the puzzle elements. The cursor
expanded from cols 56-63 to 0-63 over ~37 actions, at which point GAME_OVER triggered.
Score: 0. Levels completed: 0/6.

## Control Flow

```
iter  0  EXPLORE:data-probe            →  call arc3.start(); correctly accesses frame.frame[0] as 64x64 grid; actions=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
iter  1  EXPLORE:structure             →  log first 20 non-zero pixels, color distribution: 0=32, 2=1708, 4=304, 5=1620, 8=192, 9=144, 12=64
iter  2  EXPLORE:visualize             →  render rows 0-20 cols 0-20; sees gray(5) bg, colored rectangles (9,8,2), special pattern at rows 10-15
iter  3  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H1]  →  try action 5 (interact) — puzzle region unchanged, only row 63 changes
iter  4  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H1]  →  click at (14,10) on special pattern — zero visible change to puzzle
iter  5  EXPLORE:structure             →  scan for color-12 markers (64 pixels), check row 63; find cursor pattern 12/11
iter  6  EXPLORE:visualize             →  examine bottom rows; color 12 at row 63 cols 56-59, color 11 at cols 60-63
iter  7  EXPLORE:hyp-form        [H2]  →  cursor at row 63 moved from cols 56-59 to 60-63 after right-move; cursor is a selection mechanism
iter  8  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  move left 13 times in a loop to shift cursor leftward; cursor expands: cols 58->...->34
iter  9  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  continue 6 more left-moves; cursor expands to cols 22-63; try interact — no puzzle change
iter 10  EXTRACT:apply           [H3]  →  3 more left-moves; cursor at cols 14-63; try interact — no puzzle change; cursor at 12-63
iter 11  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H4]  ✗  click on special pattern at (14,12) — zero change; click at (12,14) — zero change
iter 12  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H4]  ✗  try 3 right-moves; cursor EXPANDS further to cols 6-63 (not shrinking); try interact — no change
iter 13  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H5]  →  try up action; cursor shifts left by 4 cols; try down — cursor shifts right by 4
iter 14  EXPLORE:hyp-test        [H5]  ✗  3 more up-moves; cursor reaches cols 0-63; GAME_OVER triggered
```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Interact/click on puzzle elements to select answer | 3-4 | rejected | zero visible change from click or interact on puzzle area |
| H2 | Row-63 cursor is a horizontal selection mechanism | 7 | superseded by H3 | cursor position changed with movement actions |
| H3 | Move cursor to align with puzzle columns, then interact | 8-10 | rejected | cursor aligns but interact still produces no change |
| H4 | Click on puzzle area while cursor is aligned | 11-12 | rejected | click still produces zero change regardless of cursor position |
| H5 | Up/down controls vertical cursor axis | 13-14 | rejected | up/down shift cursor left/right by 4 cols; GAME_OVER at full expansion |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1(direct click) -> H2(cursor discovered) -> H3(cursor alignment + interact) -> H4(cursor alignment + click) -> H5(up/down for cursor)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Frame Parsing and Structure Discovery (iter 0-2)

**Strategy:** Standard data probing with `frame.frame[0]`.
**Effectiveness:** The model correctly accessed the 64x64 grid from iter 0 with zero errors. It identified the color distribution and rendered the grid to see the puzzle structure. By iter 2, it had identified:
- Gray (5) background
- Colored rectangles: 9 (maroon) at rows 2-9 cols 4-9, 8 (azure) at rows 2-9 cols 12-17, etc.
- Special pattern at rows 10-15, cols 12-17: a 6x6 subgrid of colors 0, 2, and 8
- Row 63: cursor bar with colors 11/12

**Wasted iterations:** 0 (contrast with run-002's 1-2 iterations on frame parsing errors).

### Phase 2: Direct Interaction Attempts (iter 3-4)

**Strategy:** Try interact (action 5) and click (action 6) on puzzle elements.
**Result:** Neither had any effect on the puzzle. The only visible change was row 63 cursor expansion after action 5.
**Assessment:** The model correctly tried the most obvious interactions first.

### Phase 3: Cursor Exploration (iter 5-10)

**Strategy:** Discover and manipulate the row-63 cursor mechanism.
**Key observation (iter 7):** The cursor is a selection bar that expands as actions are taken. Left-moves expand it leftward.
**Execution:** The model used action loops (plugin guidance working) to take 13 left-moves in iter 8, then 6 more in iter 9, expanding the cursor from cols 58-63 to cols 22-63. By iter 10 it reached cols 12-63 (overlapping the puzzle pattern at cols 12-17).
**Critical failure:** The model expected interact to trigger once cursor was aligned. It didn't.
**Code pattern (iter 8):**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 13; i++) {
  const frame = await arc3.step(3); // move left
  const grid = frame.frame[0];
  let cursorCols = [];
  for (let c = 0; c < 64; c++) {
    if (grid[63][c] === 11 || grid[63][c] === 12) cursorCols.push(c);
  }
  console.log(`Move ${i+1}: cursor at cols ${Math.min(...cursorCols)}-${Math.max(...cursorCols)}`);
}
```

### Phase 4: Alternative Interactions (iter 11-14)

**Strategy:** Try clicking while cursor is aligned, try right-moves to shrink cursor, try up/down for vertical navigation.
**Discoveries:**
- Right-moves also expand the cursor (don't shrink it)
- Up shifts cursor left by ~4 cols, down shifts right by ~4 cols
- Click on puzzle area produces zero change regardless of cursor position
**Terminal event:** Iter 14 up-moves expanded cursor to cols 0-63, triggering GAME_OVER.

### Phase 5: No Return

The model hit max iterations (15) without returning. The GAME_OVER happened inside iter 14's loop but the model didn't get a chance to call `arc3.getScore()` and `return()` because it was the last iteration.

## Root Cause

The game mechanic was never discovered. The row-63 cursor appears to be a selection mechanism, but the model could not find the action or combination of actions that constitutes "submitting" a selection. Possibilities:
1. There may be a specific cursor width/position that triggers automatic selection
2. The game may require a specific action sequence not in the obvious set
3. The puzzle may require understanding the pattern-matching content (which block matches the query) before the cursor position matters

The model exhausted all available actions (interact, click, all 4 directions) without finding the submission mechanic. The cursor's expansion behavior (never shrinking, only growing) suggests the player may be meant to select the correct column range.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Game-specific documentation** -- Understanding the ft09 game mechanic (how to submit an answer) would bypass the entire exploration phase.
2. **Reset and retry** -- After discovering the cursor only expands, the model could have reset the game to try targeted cursor placements rather than continuing to expand.
3. **Pattern analysis** -- The model could have analyzed which colored rectangle matches the special pattern before worrying about the cursor, potentially revealing the intended interaction.
4. **Action budget tracking** -- The model used ~37 actions without any progress on the actual puzzle. Budget-aware reasoning would have prompted a strategy change earlier.

## Comparison to Run 002

- **Frame parsing:** Improved. Zero frame errors (vs 1 iteration lost in run-002 on TypeError).
- **Cursor discovery:** Similar. Both runs found the row-63 cursor around iter 5-6.
- **Exploration depth:** Run-005 used more actions (~37 vs ~26) thanks to action loops. The model tried more cursor positions and movement combinations.
- **Up/down discovery:** Run-005 discovered that up/down shift the cursor position (iter 13), which run-002 did not explore as deeply.
- **Outcome:** Identical -- 0/6 levels, score 0. More actions used but no progress on the core mechanic.
