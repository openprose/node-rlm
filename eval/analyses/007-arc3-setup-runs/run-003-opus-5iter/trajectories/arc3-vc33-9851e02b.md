# Trajectory: arc3-vc33-9851e02b

## Task Summary

ARC-AGI-3 interactive game `vc33-9851e02b`. Click-based puzzle with 7 levels, only action is 6 (click at x,y coordinates). The agent must observe frames, understand the puzzle layout, and click on the correct cells to solve each level.

Agent spent all 5 iterations exploring frame structure, visualizing the grid, and making one exploratory click that turned out to be a palette selector. No levels completed. Score: 0.

## Control Flow

```
iter  1  EXPLORE:structure       ✗  probe frame dimensions with 3 code blocks — TypeError on frame[y][x] (3 blocks all errored)
iter  2  EXPLORE:structure       ✓  discover frame is [1][64][64], render full 64x64 grid, identify unique values
iter  3  EXPLORE:visualize       →  extract detailed sub-regions (colored blocks, cross pattern, right half structure)
iter  4  EXPLORE:action-probe    ~  click on (52,40) — discovers palette selector at (63,0), not a game action
iter  5  EXPLORE:structure       →  enumerate all positions of values 11, 9, 4; identify canvas bounds and palette row
```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Frame is 64x64x3 (RGB) grid | 1 | rejected | frame.length=1, TypeError on frame[y][x] |
| H2 | Frame is [1][64][64] indexed grid | 2-5 | accepted | frame[0][y][x] works, produces sensible grid |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1(rejected)-->H2(accepted, used for rest of run)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Frame Structure Discovery (iter 1-2)
**Strategy:** Direct probing followed by systematic dimension checking.

**Iter 1:** Model emitted 3 separate code blocks in a single iteration, all attempting to call `arc3.start()` and then iterate over `frame.frame[y][x]`. All three failed identically:
```
Frame dimensions: 1 x 64
Channels per pixel: 64
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')
```
Output shows `arc3.start()` was called 3 times (each code block ran independently). The game was likely started and restarted. Notably, the model discovered `Available actions: 6` — click-only game.

**Iter 2:** Probed dimensions correctly:
```javascript
const grid = f.frame[0]; // 64 arrays of 64 values each
```
Found unique values: `0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11`. Built character map and rendered the full grid. The visualization revealed:
- Row 0: all 7s (header/border bar)
- Left half (cols 0-31): filled with 3s (dark background) — the "input" side
- Right half (cols 32-63): mostly 0s (black) — the "output" canvas
- A horizontal band of 5s at rows 28-31 spanning both halves, with 11s at specific positions
- Colored blocks: 9s at corners (rows 24-27, 32-35, cols 60-63), 4s and 11s forming a T/cross shape at rows 44-49

**Effectiveness:** Iter 1 fully wasted (3 identical failures). Iter 2 recovered well.

### Phase 2: Detailed Layout Analysis (iter 3)
**Strategy:** Extract specific sub-regions to understand the puzzle geometry.

Model identified and extracted:
- **9-blocks at top-right** (rows 24-27, cols 60-63): `9,9,9,9` — a 4x4 colored block
- **Horizontal 5-band** (rows 28-31): spanning cols 20-63 with 11s at cols 38-39 — a dividing line
- **9-blocks below band** (rows 32-35, cols 60-63): same 4x4 colored block
- **T-shape** (rows 44-49, cols 46-51): values 4 (at cols 48-49 rows 44-49, plus cols 46-47 at rows 46-47) and 11 (at cols 50-51)
- **Left half detail** (rows 24-35, cols 0-32): mostly 3s except the 5-band

The model correctly identified two halves (input/output) and structural elements, but did not yet form a hypothesis about what the puzzle *requires*.

### Phase 3: First Click (iter 4)
**Strategy:** Click on a black(0) cell in the output area to see what happens.

```javascript
let result = await arc3.step(6, 52, 40);  // click on a 0 cell in the right output area
```

Observed only 1 change:
```json
[{"x":63,"y":0,"old":7,"new":4}]
```

The click changed the last pixel of the header row from 7 to 4. This is a **palette selector** — clicking selected color 4 (yellow) as the active paint color. The actual canvas cell at (52,40) did not change.

**Assessment:** The model did not understand that the header row is a color palette, and clicking on the canvas paints with the selected color. This was an informative discovery but the model did not fully process its implications within this iteration.

### Phase 4: Position Enumeration (iter 5)
**Strategy:** Enumerate exact positions of all non-background values to build a complete structural map.

Found:
- **11-positions:** Two clusters — horizontal band at (38-39, 28-31) and vertical segment at (50-51, 44-49)
- **9-positions:** Two 4x4 blocks at (60-63, 24-27) and (60-63, 32-35)
- **4-positions:** The T-shape at (48-49, 44-49) + (46-47, 46-47), plus one at (63, 0) — the palette indicator
- **0-region bounds:** X: 32-63, Y: 1-63 — the entire right half is the canvas
- **Row 0 (palette):** all 7s except position 63 which is now 4 (selected color)

The model correctly identified the palette row and canvas area. Iteration limit reached before it could formulate a painting strategy.

## Root Cause

**Primary: Iteration budget exhaustion.** The click-based puzzle requires understanding:
1. The palette mechanism (click header to select color)
2. The canvas mechanism (click right half to paint)
3. What pattern to paint (the transformation from input to output)
4. Actually painting the pattern (many clicks)

At 5 iterations, the model barely discovered the palette mechanism (by accident) and never got to strategic painting.

**Secondary: Three code blocks in iter 1.** The model emitted 3 separate code blocks in iteration 1, each calling `arc3.start()` — this restarted the game 3 times and wasted the entire iteration. A single code block would have been more efficient.

**Tertiary: Click target selection.** The single click on (52, 40) happened to hit a position that only affected the palette selector, not the canvas. A click on a more informative position might have revealed the paint mechanic.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **More iterations (25+)** — Essential. This puzzle requires many individual clicks to paint a complete pattern.
2. **Frame structure documentation** — Prevent the iter 1 waste.
3. **Game type hint** — "This is a pixel-painting puzzle. Row 0 is the color palette. Click the right half to paint." would save 3 iterations of discovery.
4. **Multi-action loop** — A tight loop doing `for each cell in answer: arc3.step(6, x, y)` would allow painting the entire answer in one iteration.
5. **Single code block per iteration** — The model emitting 3 blocks in iter 1 was wasteful. A driver enforcing `max-blocks-per-iteration=1` would prevent this.
