# Trajectory: arc3-vc33-9851e02b

## Task Summary

ARC-AGI-3 interactive game `vc33-9851e02b`. Click-based puzzle with 7 levels, single available action: 6 (click at x,y). The game shows a split layout: left half (color 3 background) contains an input pattern with colored shapes, right half (color 0 background) is the output area to be filled. A header row (color 7) contains a palette/counter.

Agent correctly accessed the frame on iteration 0 (no frame structure error), explored the grid layout across 3 iterations, then spent 2 iterations clicking various positions to discover the interaction model. Took ~20 total clicks but did not understand the paint-output mechanic. Score: 0.

## Control Flow

```
iter  0  EXPLORE:visualize       →  start game (4 duplicate blocks), render downsampled grid, identify left/right split and color distribution
iter  1  EXPLORE:visualize       →  full-resolution grid render, identify exact positions of shapes (4/11/9), header bar, output area
iter  2  EXPLORE:structure       →  detailed subregion analysis: shape area, 9s area, horizontal 5-line, output area boundaries, bottom-right
iter  3  EXPLORE:action-probe [H2] ~  click output area (40,5) -- header pixel changes to 4; click (40,10) -- 2 more header pixels change
iter  4  EXPLORE:action-probe [H3] →  click 16 header positions systematically, each consumes 1-2 header pixels (7->4); header is an action counter, not a palette selector
```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Reflected symmetry -- shape below horizontal line maps to output area above | 2 | abandoned | Calculations showed reflected positions land in green (3) area, not black output area |
| H2 | Clicking output area paints cells with selected color | 3 | rejected | Clicking at (40,5) and (40,10) only changed header pixels, not output pixels |
| H3 | Header clicks select a palette color for painting | 4 | rejected | 16 header clicks all produced the same effect (7->4 pixel consumption); no palette selection behavior observed |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1(abandoned after calculation) -> H2(rejected: click changed header not output) -> H3(rejected: no palette behavior)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Initial Visualization (iter 0)
**Strategy:** Start game, render downsampled grid, count colors.
**Code:** `arc3.start()` then color counting + downsampled hex grid. Four nearly identical code blocks generated (game restarted 4 times).
**Key findings:**
- Available actions: `[6]` (click only)
- Win levels: 7
- Grid layout: left half = color 3 (green background), right half = color 0 (black, output area)
- Header row 0: all color 7 (gray)
- Colors present: 0 (1216 pixels), 3 (2580), 4 (16), 5 (168), 7 (64), 9 (32), 11 (20)
- Shapes visible: a cross/T-shape made of colors 5 (rows 28-31), 4 and 11 (rows 44-49), and 9 blocks (rows 24-27, 32-35)

**Output excerpt (downsampled):**

```

### Phase 2: Full-Resolution Grid (iter 1)
**Strategy:** Render every row at full 64-pixel resolution to see exact layout.
**Code:** `arc3.observe().frame[0]` then print all 64 rows in hex.
**Key findings:**
- Color counts: `{0: 1216, 3: 2580, 4: 16, 5: 168, 7: 64, 9: 32, 11: 20}`
- Left half (cols 0-31): all green (3) background with embedded shapes
- Right half (cols 32-63): all black (0) except for 9-blocks at rows 24-27/60-63 and 5-line at rows 28-31
- Header row 0: all 7s across full width
- Shape locations: horizontal band of 5s at rows 28-31 spanning cols 20-63, vertical band of 4/11 at rows 44-49 at cols 48-51, 9-blocks at rows 24-27/32-35 at cols 60-63

### Phase 3: Detailed Subregion Analysis (iter 2)
**Strategy:** Extract and print specific regions for closer inspection.
**Code:** Print 5 subregions: shape area, 9s area, horizontal line area, output area, bottom-right.
**Key findings:**
- Shape area (rows 44-49, cols 40-53): contains 4s and `b` (11) markers forming a cross-like pattern
- 9-blocks: symmetric above/below the 5-line, at (24-27, 60-63) and (32-35, 60-63)
- Horizontal 5-line: rows 28-31 spanning from cols 20 to 63, with `b` markers at cols 38-39
- Output area (rows 1-23, cols 32-63): entirely black (0) -- empty, waiting to be filled
- Bottom-right (rows 28-63, cols 50-63): 5-line, then 9-blocks, then green, then 0s

### Phase 4: First Interaction (iter 3)
**Strategy:** Click output area to discover the interaction model. Also attempted symmetry calculations.
**Code:** Extensive comments reasoning about reflection symmetry (H1), then `arc3.step(6, 40, 5)`.
**Result:** Click at (40,5) changed exactly 1 pixel: `(0,63): 7 -> 4`. The last pixel in the header row changed from gray to yellow. The output area was unaffected.
**Assessment:** H2 (clicking paints output) was wrong. Instead, clicks seem to increment a counter encoded in the header row. The model noted the change but did not fully understand it.

**Output excerpt:**
```
After click at (40,5):
State: NOT_FINISHED
Available actions: 6
Changes: [{"r":0,"c":63,"old":7,"new":4}]
Total changes: 1
```

### Phase 5: Systematic Header Exploration (iter 4)
**Strategy:** Click systematically across the header to understand the counter/palette mechanic.
**Code:** First click at (40,10), then loop through 16 x-positions along row 0: `[0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60]`.
**Results:** Each click consumed 1-2 more header pixels (changing 7 to 4), always from right to left. After all clicks, header had been progressively consumed:
```
Row 0: 7777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777774
After click (40,10): 2 more changes [c=61,c=62: 7->4]
Click (0,0): 1 change [c=60: 7->4]
Click (4,0): 1 change [c=59: 7->4]
...
Click (60,0): 1 change [c=41: 7->4]
```

**Assessment:** Every click anywhere on the grid consumes 1 "action credit" from the header bar (right-to-left). The header is an action counter, not a palette. The model did not determine how to actually paint the output area. The location of the click does seem to matter (some clicks consumed 2 pixels instead of 1), but the model ran out of iterations before figuring out the output-painting mechanic.

## Root Cause

Two-fold failure:
1. **Iteration budget exhaustion:** 5 iterations are insufficient to discover the full interaction model (palette selection, output painting, level completion detection) and then execute it across 7 levels.
2. **Misguided exploration in iter 4:** The model spent its last iteration clicking header positions systematically, which only consumed action credits without providing information about the painting mechanic. If it had instead tried clicking directly on specific output cells or on the input shapes, it might have discovered the correct interaction model.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Higher iteration budget (25+):** Minimum viable budget for click puzzles with palette mechanics.
2. **More targeted exploration:** Instead of scanning the header row, the model should have tried: (a) clicking on each colored shape in the input area, (b) clicking specific positions in the output grid corresponding to where shapes should go, (c) clicking on the 9-blocks or 5-line markers.
3. **Tight action loop with change detection:** A loop that clicks each pixel in the output area and observes what changes would quickly reveal the painting mechanic.
4. **Plugin guidance on click puzzles:** A hint like "in click-only games, try clicking input shapes and output cells to discover the painting/selection mechanic."
