# Trajectory: oolong-17000212

## Task Summary

Compare the frequency of 'description and abstract concept' vs 'numeric value' labels in a 3182-question dataset (317KB context).
Expected: "less common than". Got: "" (no answer). Score: 0 (timeout).

## Control Flow

```
iter 1  EXPLORE    probe context type, length, first 500 chars
iter 2  EXPLORE    split into lines, examine sample line structure
iter 3  EXPLORE    find data start index, look for label patterns
iter 4  EXPLORE    search for label keywords in sample lines
iter 5  EXPLORE    check line structure for labels in different locations
iter 6  EXPLORE    count label keyword occurrences across entire context
iter 7  EXPLORE    find first occurrence of label in header
iter 8  EXPLORE    search for 'abbreviation' occurrences throughout
iter 9  EXPLORE    examine complete line structure with split by '||'
iter 10 EXPLORE    check end of file and validate question count
iter 11 EXPLORE    examine lines after reminder text
iter 12 EXPLORE    check if labels follow questions on next lines
iter 13 EXPLORE    look for 4th field, tabs, or other delimiters
iter 14 EXPLORE    re-read header and reminder, consider implicit labels
iter 15 STALL     check byte encoding, look for single-letter patterns
```

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration (iter 1-2)
**Strategy:** Standard data probing
**Actions:** Checked context type (string, 316769 chars), split into lines (3191 total), examined structure
**Effectiveness:** Good initial reconnaissance. Correctly identified plain-text format and line-based structure.

### Phase 2: Label Search - Structural Exploration (iter 3-6)
**Strategy:** Search for labels in the data structure
**Actions:**
- iter 3: Found data starts at line 4, looked for label patterns
- iter 4: Searched for label keywords ('description and abstract concept', 'numeric value', etc.) in sample lines - found none
- iter 5: Checked line structure more carefully, examined middle of file
- iter 6: Counted label occurrences across entire context

**Key Finding (iter 6):**
```
"description and abstract concept": 2 occurrences
"numeric value": 2 occurrences
"entity": 3 occurrences
"human being": 2 occurrences
"location": 5 occurrences
"abbreviation": 66 occurrences
```

**Assessment:** Discovered labels appear very rarely in the full context. The agent correctly inferred that most occurrences are in header/footer text, not as actual labels in the data.

### Phase 3: Label Search - Location Investigation (iter 7-10)
**Strategy:** Determine where labels actually occur
**Actions:**
- iter 7: Found 'description and abstract concept' occurs in header (index 151)
- iter 8: Investigated 66 'abbreviation' occurrences, discovered they appear in questions themselves (e.g., "CPR is the abbreviation for what?"), not as labels
- iter 9: Thoroughly examined line structure - confirmed only 3 fields per line: Date, User, Instance
- iter 10: Checked end of file, validated 3182 questions present, found reminder text

**Assessment:** Good systematic investigation. Agent correctly eliminated multiple hypotheses about label location.

### Phase 4: Hypothesis Refinement (iter 11-13)
**Strategy:** Test alternative label encoding hypotheses
**Actions:**
- iter 11: Checked if labels appear after reminder text (they don't)
- iter 12: Checked if labels follow questions on next lines (they don't)
- iter 13: Looked for 4th field, tabs, semicolons, or other separators (found none)

**Assessment:** Exhaustive but unproductive. Agent was thorough but couldn't find what doesn't exist in the visible data.

### Phase 5: Confusion and Spinning (iter 14-15)
**Strategy:** Re-read instructions, search for hidden encoding
**Actions:**
- iter 14: Re-examined header, noted instructions say "Do not try to guess, estimate, or approximate" and "Calculate the exact answer given these datapoints" - interpreted this as proof labels must exist
- iter 15: Checked byte encoding, looked for single-letter label abbreviations at line ends (found only '?')

**Assessment:** Agent became stuck in circular reasoning. The strong instruction "Do not try to guess" reinforced the belief that labels must be present in the data, preventing the agent from considering that labels might need to be inferred via LLM classification.

### Timeout (after iter 15)
**Decision:** No return statement ever issued
**Result:** Hit maxIterations without attempting to answer

## Root Cause

**Primary failure: Data structure misunderstanding leading to paralysis**

The agent correctly identified that label annotations were not present in the visible data structure (only 3 fields: Date, User, Instance - no label field). However, it failed to bridge the gap between this finding and the solution approach.

**Critical evidence from the trace:**

1. **Iter 6 finding:** Only 2 occurrences each of 'description and abstract concept' and 'numeric value' in entire 317KB context (both in header/footer)

2. **Iter 8-9 finding:** "abbreviation" appears 66 times, but investigation revealed these are in the question text itself ("CPR is the abbreviation for what?"), not as labels

3. **Iter 13 finding:** Line structure thoroughly examined - only 3 fields, no 4th field for labels, no hidden delimiters

4. **Iter 14 reasoning trap:** Agent noted the instruction "Do not try to guess, estimate, or approximate the result. Calculate the exact answer given these datapoints" and concluded: "This means the labels MUST be in the data somewhere."

**The paralysis:**
The agent was caught between two conflicting beliefs:
- Empirical evidence: 15 iterations of exhaustive search found no label annotations in the data
- Instruction interpretation: "Calculate the exact answer" implied labels must be present

The agent never considered the third option: use `llm()` delegation to classify the 3182 questions into the 6 categories, then count the resulting labels.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Plugin: llm-classification-fanout** - A pre-built pattern for "classify N items into categories using llm() fan-out, then aggregate counts". The agent needed to recognize this as a classification task, not a data extraction task.

2. **Prompt guidance on implicit labels** - The system prompt could clarify: "If labels are not present in the data structure, consider whether they need to be computed (e.g., via classification)."

3. **Backtracking trigger** - After 8-10 iterations of fruitless searching, the agent should have backed up and reconsidered the problem type. A heuristic like "if spent >7 iterations on format discovery with no labels found, consider delegation approach" would help.

4. **Question interpretation over instruction literalism** - The agent over-indexed on "Calculate the exact answer given these datapoints" without recognizing that the *question types* in the datapoints (e.g., "What is a tonne?" expects a definitional answer → 'description and abstract concept') are themselves the data needed for calculation.

5. **Context window for delegation** - Had the agent attempted delegation, it would have needed to chunk 3182 questions across multiple `llm()` calls (context window limits). The missing pattern here is "classification of large dataset via batched llm() fan-out + aggregation".

## Behavioral Notes

**Pattern: Exhaustive-but-unproductive exploration**
The agent spent all 15 iterations in EXPLORE phase with no EXTRACT or DELEGATE attempts. This is unusual - most trajectories transition to extraction by iteration 4-6.

**Pattern: Data-structure-confusion**
The agent correctly mapped the data structure but couldn't make the conceptual leap from "labels are not annotated" to "labels must be inferred."

**Anti-pattern: No delegation consideration**
Despite the task requiring classification of 3182 items into 6 categories - a textbook `llm()` use case - the agent never mentioned or attempted delegation. This suggests the pattern matching for "when to use llm()" didn't fire.

**Instruction interpretation failure:**
The phrase "Do not try to guess, estimate, or approximate" was intended to mean "compute exact counts, don't round or estimate statistics" but was interpreted as "the exact labels must be in the data, keep searching."
