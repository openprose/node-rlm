# Trajectory: oolong-17000208

## Task Summary

Determine label statistics for 3182 general-knowledge questions across 6 categories ('description and abstract concept', 'entity', 'human being', 'numeric value', 'location', 'abbreviation'). The context contains questions in `Date: ... || User: ... || Instance: question` format with NO pre-assigned labels. The RLM was expected to classify each question and compute aggregate statistics, answering "numeric value". Got: "" (empty). Score: 0 (timeout).

## Control Flow
```
iter 1  EXPLORE+EXTRACT  probe context, hallucinate different data format, compute on hallucinated data, return("entity") — intercepted by early-return guard, then timeout
```

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Single Iteration with Massive Hallucination (iter 1)

**What the model claimed happened (in reasoning):**
The reasoning contains 6 code blocks with interleaved `<execution_output>` blocks. The model claimed:
1. `context.length` = 142,880 and format was alternating question/label lines
2. Total lines: 10,802
3. Extracted 5,401 labels with clean counts: entity=1251, desc=1236, human=1223, numeric=896, location=835, abbreviation=9
4. Most common label: "entity" (1251)
5. Verified with sorted output
6. Called `return("entity")`

**What actually happened (from real output):**
1. `context.length` = 316,769 (2.2x the hallucinated value)
2. Total lines: 3,189 (not 10,802)
3. Data format: `Date: Sep 06, 2023 || User: 14512 || Instance: What is a tonne ?` — no labels present
4. The even/odd line extraction treated every other data line as a "label", producing 1,594 entries — almost all unique question lines misidentified as labels
5. Label counts showed: `"": 3` (empty strings from blank lines) and ~1,591 unique data lines each with count 1
6. Most common label was empty string `""` with count 3, not "entity" with count 1251
7. `return("entity")` was intercepted by the early-return guard with message: `[early return intercepted] You returned: entity\nVerify this is correct by examining the data before returning.`
8. The operation then timed out — the model never got a second iteration to correct

**Strategy:** The model generated all 6 code blocks in a single reasoning turn with fabricated `<execution_output>` blocks inline. It never observed the actual execution results before deciding on an answer.

**Effectiveness:** Catastrophically wrong. Every intermediate result in the reasoning was hallucinated. The model fabricated a completely different dataset format (alternating question/label lines) when the actual data had no labels at all.

## Root Cause

**Primary: `multi-block-hallucination`** — The model generated all 6 code blocks within a single iteration's reasoning, with fabricated execution outputs between them. It never paused to observe actual results after any code block. This is the fundamental failure: the model treated code execution as a thought experiment rather than an empirical operation.

**Secondary: `wrong-format-assumption`** — The model hallucinated that the context contained pre-assigned labels in alternating question/label format. The actual data contained only questions in `Date: ... || User: ... || Instance: question` format with NO labels. The task required the RLM to classify 3,182 questions into categories — a fundamentally different (and much harder) task than simply counting pre-existing labels.

**Tertiary: `timeout` after early-return interception** — The early-return guard correctly intercepted the `return("entity")` call and asked the model to verify. But the model had already used its single iteration. The timeout occurred because no second iteration was available (or the wall-clock limit was reached).

Key evidence of hallucination:

| Property | Hallucinated | Actual |
|---|---|---|
| `context.length` | 142,880 | 316,769 |
| Total lines | 10,802 | 3,189 |
| Data format | question\nlabel alternating | `Date: \|\| User: \|\| Instance: question` |
| Labels present | Yes (pre-assigned) | No (classification required) |
| Labels extracted | 5,401 clean labels | 1,594 garbage entries |
| Most common label | "entity" (1,251) | "" (empty string, 3) |

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Single code block per iteration** — If the model had executed one code block, observed the actual output, and then written the next code block in a subsequent iteration, it would have immediately seen that (a) the context length was 316,769 not 142,880, (b) there were only 3,189 lines, and (c) the format was `Date: || User: || Instance:` with no labels. This would have prevented the entire cascade of hallucinated results.

2. **Format-aware parsing** — The actual data format (`Date: ... || User: ... || Instance: question`) required parsing the `Instance:` field to extract questions. The model should have detected this format from the first 500 chars output and parsed accordingly.

3. **Delegation for classification** — Since no labels were pre-assigned, the task required classifying 3,182 questions into 6 categories. This is a natural fit for `llm()` fan-out: chunk the questions and use `Promise.all()` with `llm()` calls to classify batches, then aggregate counts. Without delegation, this task is nearly impossible to solve within iteration limits.

4. **More iterations budget** — With only 1 iteration available (and the early-return guard consuming the only chance to correct), the model had no opportunity to recover from its hallucinated reasoning. A higher iteration budget would have allowed the model to observe real output and adapt.

5. **Early-return guard as iteration-saver** — The early-return guard correctly identified the premature return, but the timeout meant the model could not act on the feedback. If the guard's feedback had been available as a prompt for a new iteration before timeout, the model might have had a chance to discover the format mismatch.
