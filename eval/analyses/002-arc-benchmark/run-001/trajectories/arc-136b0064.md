# Trajectory: arc-136b0064

## Task Summary

ARC task with 3 training examples (15x15, 7x15, 11x15 inputs producing 15x7, 7x7, 11x7 outputs) and 1 test case (19x15). The input grid is divided by a column of 4s (column 7) into a left section (cols 0-6, containing colored patterns in groups separated by zero rows) and a right section (cols 8-14, containing a single marker value). The transformation requires analyzing the left section's grouped patterns and the marker to produce the output. The model explored extensively but never cracked the full transformation rule. Hit max iterations (25) without returning. Score: 0.

## Control Flow

```
iter 1  EXPLORE     parse task, log dimensions (outputs are width 7, inputs width 15)
iter 2  EXPLORE     visualize all training examples — see column-7 separator of 4s
iter 3  EXPLORE     identify left/right sections divided by column of 4s
iter 4  EXPLORE     find groups in left section (separated by zero rows), locate marker in right
iter 5  EXPLORE     log group contents, identify marker positions
iter 6  EXTRACT     test hypothesis: marker column determines extraction — partial match
iter 7  EXPLORE     compare output with right section directly — most output rows differ
iter 8  EXTRACT     analyze how left section data maps to output positions
iter 9  EXTRACT     analyze per-row color counts (left side cols 0-2, right side cols 4-6)
iter 10 EXTRACT     investigate how counts relate to output colors and positions
iter 11 EXTRACT     count non-zero cells per side, analyze relationship to output
iter 12 EXTRACT     test "left count placed at marker" hypothesis — partial match
iter 13 EXTRACT     analyze placement logic (centering around marker column)
iter 14 EXTRACT     test "count becomes color value" hypothesis — some matches
iter 15 EXTRACT     systematic placement analysis — "L=count@color R=count@color"
iter 16 EXTRACT     test "bigger count wins" hypothesis — partial match
iter 17 EXTRACT     analyze which original color appears in output
iter 18 EXTRACT     test "losing side's color gets output" hypothesis — inconsistent
iter 19 EXTRACT     try group-level analysis instead of row-level
iter 20 EXTRACT     test "left wins -> output right color" at group level — inconsistent
iter 21 EXTRACT     formulate complex multi-rule hypothesis (count as color)
iter 22 EXTRACT     analyze group-level totals and output patterns
iter 23 EXTRACT     test "losing side's color" hypothesis at group level — partial match
iter 24 EXTRACT     detailed row-by-row analysis within groups
iter 25 EXTRACT     focus on "count as color" pattern — partial understanding at timeout
```

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Structure Discovery (iter 1-5)
**Strategy:** Standard ARC exploration with focus on grid structure.

**Key findings:**
- Column 7 is a separator filled with 4s
- Left section (cols 0-6) contains colored groups separated by zero-rows
- Right section (cols 8-14) contains a single marker value (color 5) at a specific row/column
- Output width is 7 (same as each half-section)
- Output height matches input height

**Effectiveness:** Good structural analysis. All key components identified.

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Exploration (iter 6-18)
**Strategy:** Tested a series of hypotheses about how left-section patterns map to output cells:

1. **Marker column extraction** (iter 6): Does the marker column determine which column to extract from each group? Partial match.
2. **Direct comparison** (iter 7): Is the output a modified right section? No — most rows differ.
3. **Position mapping** (iter 8-9): Analyzed per-row color counts on left (cols 0-2) and right (cols 4-6) sides.
4. **Count-determines-placement** (iter 10-12): Does the count of colored cells on each side determine where output values go? Partially.
5. **Count-as-color** (iter 14): Does the count itself become the color value in the output? Matches some rows.
6. **Winner-takes-all** (iter 16): Does the side with more colored cells determine the output? Sometimes.
7. **Losing-side-color** (iter 18): Does the losing side's color appear in the output? Inconsistent.

**Effectiveness:** Each hypothesis explained some rows but failed on others. The model correctly identified individual row patterns but could not find a unified rule. The actual rule likely involves a combination of counting, color selection, and position placement that the model partially grasped but couldn't synthesize.

### Phase 3: Group-Level Analysis (iter 19-25)
**Strategy:** Shifted from row-level to group-level analysis, comparing total counts across groups.

**Result:** Group-level analysis showed that left-vs-right total counts determine a "winner" but the color selection and placement rules remained elusive. The model found that `r1: L=2@2 R=1@6 -> out=2x2` (left count 2, used as color, placed in 2 cells) works for some rows, but other rows use different rules.

**At timeout:** The model had partial understanding: for some rows, the count of non-zero cells becomes the output color value, and the placement relates to the marker position. But the full rule — including which color is used, where values are placed, and how groups interact — remained unsynthesized.

## Root Cause

**Primary failure: Rule synthesis from partial observations**

The model correctly observed many individual facts about the transformation:
- Output preserves the marker row
- Counts of colored cells on left and right sides matter
- Sometimes the count itself becomes the color value
- Placement relates to the marker column position
- Groups separated by zero-rows are processed independently

But it could not synthesize these observations into a complete, consistent rule. Each hypothesis explained 60-70% of rows, and the model cycled between hypotheses without building toward a unified theory.

**Technical gap:** The actual transformation rule appears to involve: for each non-marker row, compare the left-side count and right-side count, then place the winning count as a color value at positions determined by the marker column and the losing side's geometry. The model circled around this but never formulated it precisely enough to implement.

**Secondary failure: No `return()` call**

The model never attempted to return a solution. Even applying the partially correct "count as color" rule to rows where it works, and falling back to copying the input for other rows, would have produced a partially correct output.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Structured hypothesis testing framework** — A tool that takes a candidate transformation function and tests it on all training examples, reporting exact match percentage per cell. This would have allowed rapid iteration on rule variants.

2. **Row-by-row ground truth comparison** — For each training example row, a side-by-side display showing input left, input right, output, and the hypothesized output. The model did this manually but having it automated would have made partial correctness immediately visible.

3. **Rule template library** — ARC tasks often use counting, comparison, color selection, and position mapping. A template like "for each row: count(left) vs count(right) -> winner selects color/position" with parameterizable variants would have structured the search.

4. **Fallback return strategy** — After 20+ iterations, apply the best partial rule and return. Even if incorrect for some rows, it would be better than timeout.

5. **ARC solver plugin** — Systematic enumeration of common ARC transformation primitives (count, compare, select, place) and their compositions, tested against all training examples.

## Novel Patterns Observed

### `hypothesis-cycling`
The model cycled through 7+ related-but-distinct hypotheses, each partially explaining the transformation. Unlike `hypothesis-thrashing` (jumping between unrelated approaches), hypothesis-cycling involves refining the same basic idea through different lenses without converging. The hypotheses were: column extraction, count-determines-placement, count-as-color, winner-takes-all, losing-side-color, group-level, and row-level variants. Each was a plausible interpretation of the same underlying rule.

### `under-verification`
Many hypotheses were tested on only a few rows of one training example before being refined or abandoned. More rigorous testing (all rows, all training examples) would have provided clearer signal about which hypothesis components were correct.
