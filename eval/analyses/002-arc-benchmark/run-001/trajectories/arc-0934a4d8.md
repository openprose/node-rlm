# Trajectory: arc-0934a4d8

## Task Summary

ARC task with 4 training examples (30x30 inputs, variable-sized outputs: 9x4, 4x5, 3x7, 4x4) and 1 test case (30x30). The task involves finding a rectangular region filled with a "corruption" color (color 8) and reconstructing its original content using the symmetry of the surrounding pattern. Expected output: 9x3 grid. Hit max iterations (25) without returning. Score: 0.

## Control Flow

```
iter 1  EXPLORE     parse task structure, count examples, log dimensions
iter 2  EXPLORE     visualize Train 0 input (first 10 rows) and output
iter 3  EXPLORE     count color frequencies in Train 0, locate colors 2 and 7
iter 4  EXPLORE     find bounding box of colors 2+7 (frame), extract 22x22 inner region
iter 5  EXPLORE     visualize frame pattern (2s and 7s) within rows 4-27
iter 6  EXPLORE     find color 7 bounding box (rows 8-23, cols 8-23), extract 14x14 inner region
iter 7  EXTRACT     find color 2 pattern within 7-frame, extract 14x12 bounded region

iter 12 EXPLORE     find connected components of color 2 (22 regions found)
iter 13 EXPLORE     print full 30x30 grid with all values
iter 14 EXTRACT     find color 8 positions — BINGO: 36 cells at rows 14-22, cols 25-28 = 9x4 matching output
iter 15 EXPLORE     check global symmetry (vertical and horizontal) — neither found
iter 16 EXPLORE     search for horizontal reflection symmetry axis for rows containing 8s
iter 17 EXTRACT     check symmetry within 7-framed inner region (cols 9-22) — all rows symmetric
iter 18 EXPLORE     realize 8-region (cols 25-28) is OUTSIDE the 7-frame (cols 8-23)
iter 19 EXTRACT     reconstruct cols 25-28 via full-row horizontal symmetry (mirror around col 14.5)
iter 20 VERIFY      compare reconstructed values with expected output — mismatch (6449 vs 9964)
iter 21 EXTRACT     try reversed column order — still mismatch (9446 vs 9964)
iter 22 EXTRACT     try different column mappings (cols 1-4 for rows 14-22) — still mismatch
iter 23 EXTRACT     try transposed reading (cols as rows) — still mismatch
iter 24 STALL       no progress, testing same approaches
iter 25 STALL       no progress, hit max iterations
```

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Structure Exploration (iter 1-5)
**Strategy:** Standard ARC probing — parse JSON, visualize grids, count colors, identify structural markers (colors 2 and 7 form frame-like patterns).

**Effectiveness:** Solid. By iter 5, the model had identified the nested frame structure of colors 2 and 7 and visualized it clearly. This was correct foundational work.

### Phase 2: Frame Analysis (iter 6-10)
**Strategy:** Systematically investigated the nested frames — color 7 forms an outer frame (rows 8-23, cols 8-23), color 2 forms patterns within. Attempted to match extracted regions to the output.

**Result:** The 14x14 inner region, 14x12 color-2-bounded region, and various subsampling strategies all failed to produce the 9x4 output.

**Effectiveness:** Thorough but misdirected. The model spent 5 iterations exploring frame interiors when the actual corruption region was *outside* the frame.

### Phase 3: Broadening Search (iter 11-14)
**Strategy:** Expanded search to the full 30x30 grid. Tried connected components of color 2, visualized the entire grid, and finally searched for color 8 positions.

**Key discovery (iter 14):** Color 8 appears as a solid 9x4 rectangle at rows 14-22, cols 25-28, exactly matching the output dimensions. This was the critical insight: color 8 marks a "corrupted" region that needs reconstruction.

**Effectiveness:** Excellent. The model correctly identified the corruption pattern. This was the breakthrough that should have led to a solution.

### Phase 4: Reconstruction Attempts (iter 15-23)
**Strategy:** Tried multiple symmetry-based reconstruction approaches:
- Global vertical/horizontal symmetry (iter 15) — failed
- Row-level horizontal symmetry axis search (iter 16) — no axis found
- Inner-region row symmetry (iter 17) — confirmed symmetric but region is outside frame
- Full-row mirror around col 14.5 (iter 19) — produced `6449` instead of `9964`
- Reversed column order (iter 21) — produced `9446` instead of `9964`
- Alternative column mappings (iter 22) — same values
- Transposed reading (iter 23) — still wrong

**Critical observation:** The reconstructed values `6449` are the *reverse* of the first 4 digits of the expected `9964`. But neither `6449` nor `9446` nor `9964` appeared in the locations the model checked. The model noticed this numeric near-miss but could not find the correct transformation.

**What the model missed:** The grid likely has point symmetry (180-degree rotation) or a more complex multi-axis symmetry where the corruption region maps to a different quadrant via both row AND column reflection. The model only tried single-axis reflections.

### Phase 5: Stalling (iter 24-25)
**Strategy:** Continued testing the same row-column mappings without new hypotheses.

**Result:** No progress. Hit max iterations.

## Root Cause

**Primary failure: Incomplete symmetry exploration**

The model correctly identified the corruption region (color 8, 9x4 block) and the frame structure (colors 2 and 7), but failed to find the correct symmetry operation that maps the corrupted region to its uncorrupted counterpart.

The reconstruction produced `6449` when `9964` was expected. These are not simple reverses of each other — they contain different digits (6,4,4,9 vs 9,9,6,4). The model needed to find a 2D symmetry operation (likely point reflection through the grid center, or a compound of horizontal + vertical + diagonal reflections) but only tested 1D row-level reflections.

**Secondary failure: No `return()` call**

Despite spending 12 iterations (14-25) with the correct problem identification (reconstruct the 8-filled region), the model never submitted even a best-guess answer. At iteration 19-20, it had a reconstruction attempt that was close to the expected answer's structure (same dimensions, plausible values). Submitting that would have been better than timeout.

**Pattern: `near-miss-abandonment`** — The model identified the correct problem structure, generated candidate solutions, saw they were close but not matching, and continued iterating instead of submitting the best candidate.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Systematic symmetry enumeration** — A helper that, given a corruption region, tests all standard symmetry operations (horizontal reflection, vertical reflection, 180-degree rotation, diagonal reflections, and combinations) and shows which one reconstructs each training example. This would have found the correct operation in 1 iteration instead of 12.

2. **ARC solver plugin** — The `arc-solver` plugin could provide structured hypothesis testing across all training examples, preventing the single-example exploration that consumed iterations 1-13.

3. **Fallback return strategy** — After N iterations without a verified solution, submit the best candidate. The reconstruction from iter 19 was structurally correct (right dimensions, plausible values from the grid) and would have been better than no answer.

4. **Multi-example verification** — The model only deeply analyzed Train 0. Testing the corruption-reconstruction hypothesis on all 4 training examples simultaneously would have revealed which symmetry operation works universally.

5. **2D symmetry tools** — The model tested row-by-row reflection (1D) but never tested point reflection or compound symmetries. A `reflectGrid(grid, axis)` utility supporting multiple reflection types would have covered the hypothesis space faster.

## Novel Patterns Observed

### `near-miss-abandonment`
The model identified the correct problem structure and generated candidate solutions that were structurally close (right dimensions, values from the grid) but numerically wrong. Instead of submitting the best candidate, it continued iterating until timeout. This is distinct from `hypothesis-thrashing` (which involves jumping between unrelated approaches) — here the model stayed on the right track but couldn't close the gap.

### `no-return`
The model never called `return()` across 25 iterations. This is the defining behavioral pattern of this entire benchmark run (4 of 5 tasks exhibit it). The model treated `return()` as something to call only when confident of correctness, not as a fallback for best-effort submission.
