# Trajectory: arc-78332cb0

## Task Summary

ARC task: Input grids contain rectangular panels separated by lines of 6s. Each panel has colored (non-background, non-6) cells on its edges that serve as connection endpoints. The output rearranges the panels into a connected chain where the exit point of one panel matches the entry point of the next. The agent determines output orientation (horizontal vs vertical chaining) by examining which edges of each panel have endpoints.

Training examples: 3 examples. Agent achieved 100% training accuracy on attempt 0 in 7 iterations (7 inference calls). Test output hidden (ARC-AGI-2).

## Control Flow

```
iter  1  EXPLORE:parse               ->  display all I/O grids, note dimensions and structure
iter  2  EXPLORE:visualize           ->  display challenge grids for generalization check
iter  3  EXTRACT:implement       [H1] +  deep reasoning (16K output tokens): analyze panel structure, identify endpoint matching, implement full transform with edge_info and build_chain -- 3/3 train pass
iter  4  VERIFY:spot-check            ->  display challenge output, verify it looks reasonable
iter  5  VERIFY:spot-check            ->  second visual check of challenge output
iter  6  RETURN                       ->  prepare FinalSolution
iter  7  RETURN                       +  return FinalSolution
```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Panels chain together by matching colored endpoint cells on edges; output orientation determined by which edges have endpoints | 3 | **accepted** | 3/3 training examples pass on first implementation |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1 (accepted immediately -- single-shot solve)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Exploration (iter 1-2)
**Strategy:** Standard ARC exploration: display all training I/O grids and challenge grids. The agent noted the dimensions, identified the 6-lines as separators, and observed the colored endpoint cells on panel edges.
**Effectiveness:** Efficient. Two iterations for full data inspection before any coding.

### Phase 2: Implementation (iter 3)
**Strategy:** Extended reasoning (16K output tokens) worked through the problem analytically before writing code. The agent identified: (a) panels are rectangular regions separated by lines of 6s, (b) each panel has colored cells on its top/bottom or left/right edges, (c) the exit point of one panel must match the entry point of the next, (d) output orientation is determined by which edge pairs have endpoints.
**Result:** Full implementation on the first attempt. Algorithm extracts panels, computes edge_info (which edges have non-background, non-6 colored cells), builds a chain by matching exit/entry endpoints, and assembles the output grid. All 3 training examples pass with 100% accuracy.
**Assessment:** Exemplary single-shot implementation. The agent front-loaded all the analytical work into a long reasoning block, then wrote correct code on the first try.

### Phase 3: Verification (iter 4-5)
**Strategy:** Visual inspection of challenge output to ensure it generalizes.
**Assessment:** Good practice -- checking challenge output catches issues that 100% training accuracy might mask.

### Phase 4: Return (iter 6-7)
**Decision:** Return the working solution.

## Key Insight

The panels in the input grid are separated by lines of 6s and need to be rearranged into a connected chain. The critical insight is that each panel has colored cells (neither background nor 6) on specific edges that serve as entry/exit points. The output chains panels so that the exit point of each panel (e.g., a colored cell on the bottom edge) aligns with the entry point of the next panel (e.g., a colored cell on the top edge). The output orientation (horizontal vs vertical) is determined by whether the endpoints appear on top/bottom edges (vertical chain) or left/right edges (horizontal chain).

## What Worked Well

1. **Front-loaded reasoning** -- 16K tokens of analytical reasoning before writing any code. The agent worked through the panel separation, endpoint detection, chain-building, and orientation logic entirely in its reasoning block, then wrote correct code in a single implementation.
2. **Single-shot implementation** -- The first (and only) code attempt passed all 3 training examples. No hypothesis churn, no debugging iterations.
3. **Efficient iteration budget** -- 7 total iterations for a complete solve is very lean. Only 3 inference calls contained substantive reasoning/code.
4. **Challenge verification** -- The agent spent 2 iterations visually inspecting challenge output, which is good practice even when training accuracy is perfect.
