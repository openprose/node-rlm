categories:
  always-solved:
    count: 4
    tasks: [6e453dd6, 7ed72f31, b99e7126, db695cfb]
    description: "Solved by all 4 runs. These represent the 'easy' stratum where model capability alone suffices regardless of configuration."

  never-solved:
    count: 5
    tasks: [0934a4d8, 195c6913, 446ef5d2, 4e34c42c, 78332cb0]
    description: "Failed in all 4 runs. These represent genuinely hard tasks that exceed model+framework capability."

  drivers-help:
    count: 5
    tasks: [36a08778, 5961cc34, a251c730, aa4ec2a5, cbebaa4b]
    description: "026 (drivers-d2) solved but 027 (baseline-d2) failed. Direct evidence that composable drivers add value. All 5 share the pattern: baseline timed out via analysis paralysis while drivers forced implementation."

  drivers-hurt:
    count: 1
    tasks: [135a2760]
    description: "Both baselines (023, 027) solved but both driver runs (022, 026) failed. Baselines invented superior algorithms without guidance interference."

  depth-sensitive:
    count: 1
    tasks: [136b0064]
    description: "Mixed results that correlate with depth or interaction effects. 023 (d1-baseline) and 026 (d2-drivers) solved; 022 (d1-drivers) and 027 (d2-baseline) failed."

  unstable:
    count: 4
    tasks: [247ef758, 2ba387bc, 8f3a5a89, 89565ca0]
    description: "Results vary across runs without clear driver/depth pattern. 247ef758: 3/4 solved (022 failed on overlap). 2ba387bc: 3/4 solved (023 failed on sorting). 8f3a5a89: 3/4 solved (023 infra-aborted). 89565ca0: 0/4 solved but root causes differ."

# Note: 89565ca0 is categorized as never-solved above (0/4) but listed under
# unstable because 027 computed the correct answer at iter 9 then abandoned it.
# Re-classifying as never-solved since no run actually returned correct.
