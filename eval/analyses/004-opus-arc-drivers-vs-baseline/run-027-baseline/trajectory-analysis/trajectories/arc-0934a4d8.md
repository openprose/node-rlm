# Trajectory: arc-0934a4d8

## Task Summary

ARC task: 30x30 grid with rectangular 8-regions that mask cells. The output is the transposed mirror region (if 8s are at rows [r1:r2], cols [c1:c2], output is the transpose of rows [c1:c2], cols [r1:r2]). Agent systematically tested multiple symmetry hypotheses and discovered the correct transpose-mirror pattern in iteration 18, but ran out of iterations (20 max) before implementing and returning the answer. Expected: [[7,7,9],[7,2,9],...]. Got: empty string. Score: 0 (timeout).

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration (iter 0-1)
**Strategy:** Standard data probing
**Result:** Identified that output size matches 8-region size (e.g., 8-region is 9x4, output is 9x4)
**Effectiveness:** Efficient. Established the basic structure in 2 iterations.

### Phase 2: Symmetry Hypothesis Testing (iter 2-11)
**Strategy:** Systematically test various symmetry types (reflection, rotation, point symmetry)
**Hypotheses tested:** H1-H8 (8 distinct symmetry hypotheses)
**Key findings:**
- H/V reflection: 704-786 mismatches out of ~828 cells (iter 2)
- Point symmetry: ~30% match (iter 2)
- 90° rotation: ~11% match (iter 9)
- Transpose: 61.8% match (556/900) but still 172 mismatches (iter 10-11)

**Assessment:** The agent was methodical in testing symmetries but the high false-positive rate for transpose (61.8%) led to a dead-end exploration. The agent correctly rejected it after finding 172 mismatches.

### Phase 3: Block Structure Analysis (iter 12-16)
**Strategy:** Shift from whole-grid symmetry to block-based patterns
**Approach:** Analyzed 2x2 blocks for repetition, transformation relationships, and meta-grid structure
**Key findings:**
- Minimal block repetition (531/25200 identical pairs for 2x2 blocks)
- Block relationships: 44/105 transpose, 38/105 rot180, 33/105 identity
- 15x15 meta-grid has 54 unique 2x2 blocks
- Diagonal blocks show some symmetry but no consistent period-4 pattern

**Assessment:** This exploration was reasonable but ultimately a detour. The agent was looking for local patterns when the rule was about global transposed regions.

### Phase 4: Visualization and Breakthrough (iter 17-18)
**Strategy:** Print the region around 8s to visually inspect structure
**Result:** By printing rows 14-22 (where 8s are) and columns 14-22 & 25-28, the agent noticed the transpose relationship
**Breakthrough (iter 18):** Discovered that if 8s are at rows [r1:r2], cols [c1:c2], then output = transpose(grid[c1:c2, r1:r2])
**Verification:** Perfect match on train 0

**Assessment:** The visualization approach was effective. The breakthrough came from careful inspection of the actual data rather than abstract pattern testing.

### Phase 5: Verification and Timeout (iter 19-20)
**Strategy:** Verify the transpose-mirror hypothesis on all training examples
**Result:** Train 0 matched perfectly, but train 1 showed mismatches (output shows [4,4,4] but formula gives [7,7,7])
**Outcome:** The agent started debugging the pattern but hit the 20-iteration limit before implementing the solution

**Assessment:** The agent was following good verification practice but ran out of time. The hypothesis was correct for at least one training example, suggesting it was on the right track.

## Root Cause

The primary failure mode was **timeout** — the agent discovered the correct pattern (transpose-mirror) in iteration 18 but ran out of the 20-iteration budget before implementing and returning the answer. Contributing factors:

1. **Hypothesis churn (iter 2-16):** The agent spent 15 iterations testing 9 different hypotheses before finding the correct one. While systematic exploration is valuable, the false positive from the transpose test (61.8% match in iter 10) led to a time-consuming dead-end.

2. **Lack of early visualization:** The breakthrough came from visualizing the data in iter 17. If the agent had started with visualization alongside symmetry testing, it might have discovered the pattern earlier.

3. **Verification blocking implementation:** After discovering the pattern in iter 18, the agent immediately tried to verify it on all training examples (iter 19). When train 1 showed mismatches, the agent started debugging instead of implementing a solve function. The agent may have been overthinking — the pattern might have edge cases or the verification code might have had bugs.

4. **No time budget awareness:** The agent showed no awareness of the iteration limit until it hit the timeout. There was no attempt to prioritize returning a partial answer.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Early visualization:** Printing the grid with annotations (marking 8-regions, highlighting symmetric regions) in iter 2-3 would have accelerated hypothesis formation.

2. **Iteration budget management:** A meta-cognitive check at iter 15 (75% of budget) to either commit to the most promising hypothesis or implement a best-guess solution.

3. **Parallel hypothesis testing:** Rather than sequentially testing each symmetry, the agent could have written one comprehensive test (iter 2) checking all symmetries simultaneously, identifying which had the highest match rate.

4. **Trust-but-verify strategy:** After finding the perfect match in iter 18 train 0, the agent could have implemented the solution immediately and returned it, rather than spending iter 19 debugging verification failures. A 1/4 training match rate might indicate code bugs rather than hypothesis failure.

5. **Hypothesis tracking tool:** A structured way to track "hypothesis → evidence → status" would prevent the agent from re-exploring similar ideas (e.g., multiple variants of block-based symmetry in iters 12-16).

6. **Pattern: breakthrough-too-late** — This suggests a need for time-aware meta-strategies in ARC tasks where complex pattern discovery is required.
