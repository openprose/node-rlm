# Trajectory: arc-136b0064

## Task Summary

ARC task requiring pattern recognition and transformation of a 15-column grid into a 7-column output. The input contains blocks of shapes separated by a vertical line, with a starting marker (value 5). The agent must decode how these blocks encode a path-tracing transformation. Agent explored 10+ distinct hypotheses over 20 iterations but failed to converge on a solution before timing out. Score: 0 (timeout).

## Control Flow

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Input structure has vertical separator at col 6 | 0-2 | accepted (partial) | separator column found, but not sufficient |
| H2 | Value 5 is a starting position marker | 3 | accepted (partial) | 5 moves between input/output columns |
| H3 | Output traces a connected path from marker 5 | 4-5 | superseded by H4 | path structure visible but encoding unclear |
| H4 | Blocks encode direction and distance like arrows | 5-6 | rejected | shape-to-direction mapping inconsistent |
| H5 | Path alternates horizontal and vertical segments | 7-8 | rejected | segment structure doesn't cleanly alternate |
| H6 | Shapes indicate directions (triangle, U, V, etc.) | 9-11 | rejected | no consistent shape-to-direction mapping found |
| H7 | Block order determines path segment order | 12 | rejected | output colors don't match block order |
| H8 | Colors and lengths encoded separately per row | 13-14 | rejected | per-row encoding doesn't match output structure |
| H9 | Each block produces 3 rows of output | 15-17 | rejected | block-to-row mapping has mismatches |
| H10 | Colors have fixed movement patterns (e.g., 6→0, 2→-1) | 18-19 | abandoned | partial pattern found but incomplete, ran out of time |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1→H2→H3(path structure)→H4(arrows)→H5(H/V alternation)→H6(shape directions)→H7(block order)→H8(per-row encoding)→H9(3-row blocks)→H10(color movement patterns)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration and Format Discovery (iter 0-2)
**Strategy:** Standard data probing and visualization
**Effectiveness:** Efficient. Quickly identified key structural elements: 15→7 column transformation, vertical separator at column 6, presence of blocks with distinct shapes.
**Key findings:**
- Input: 15 columns, output: 7 columns (height preserved)
- Separator column (value 4 in train examples) divides input at column 6
- Left side (cols 0-5) contains colored blocks/shapes
- Right side (cols 7-14) mostly empty
- Value 5 appears as a position marker

### Phase 2: Path Structure Hypothesis (iter 3-8)
**Strategy:** Hypothesized that the output represents a path traced from marker 5, with blocks encoding movement instructions
**Effectiveness:** Partially successful. Correctly identified the output as a path structure, but struggled to decode the exact encoding scheme.
**Detailed observations:**
- Iter 3: Noticed marker 5 moves from input column to output column (9→1, 11→3, 12→4)
- Iter 4-5: Analyzed output as connected path segments with different colors
- Iter 6: Attempted to classify segments by direction (H/V) and count lengths
- Iter 7-8: Tested if path alternates between horizontal and vertical segments, found inconsistencies

**Assessment:** The agent correctly identified the high-level pattern (path tracing) but couldn't determine the precise encoding rules for how blocks map to path segments.

### Phase 3: Shape-as-Direction Hypothesis (iter 9-12)
**Strategy:** Attempted to interpret left/right shapes within blocks as directional indicators (arrows, pointers)
**Effectiveness:** Ineffective. No consistent mapping emerged from this approach.
**Key attempts:**
- Iter 9-11: Cataloged distinct shapes (U-down, triangle-right, V-down, line-SE, zigzag) and tried to map them to directions
- Iter 12: Tested if block processing order matches path segment order, found color mismatches

**Assessment:** This was a reasonable hypothesis given arrow-like patterns in the data, but the agent spent 4 iterations without finding confirming evidence. Should have pivoted sooner.

### Phase 4: Row-Level Encoding Hypothesis (iter 13-17)
**Strategy:** Shifted to testing if each row within a block encodes something independently
**Effectiveness:** Partially effective. Found some structure but hit contradictions.
**Key attempts:**
- Iter 13-14: Tested if colors and directions are encoded separately per row
- Iter 15-16: Hypothesized each 3-row block produces 3 rows of output
- Iter 17: Found mismatches when validating block-to-row mapping on train examples

**Assessment:** The agent was getting warmer but still missing the complete pattern. The observation that blocks have 3 rows was relevant but the mapping logic remained unclear.

### Phase 5: Color Movement Pattern Hypothesis (iter 18-19)
**Strategy:** Analyzed per-color movement patterns across all training examples
**Effectiveness:** Promising but incomplete. Identified consistent patterns (e.g., color 6 always moves 0, color 2 always moves -1) but ran out of iterations before implementation.
**Key findings:**
- Color 6 consistently moves 0 (straight down/stays in place)
- Color 2 consistently moves -1 (shifts left)
- Color 1 moves +2 (shifts right)
- Color 3 moves -3 (shifts left more)

**Assessment:** This was likely on the right track. The agent discovered a per-color movement encoding but failed to synthesize this into a complete solution algorithm before the 20-iteration limit.

### Phase 6: Stall and Timeout (iter 19)
**Strategy:** Continued analyzing shape details without a clear new hypothesis
**Effectiveness:** Unproductive. Agent was analyzing "colSums" and "rowSums" of right shapes but not formulating a testable hypothesis or implementation plan.
**Assessment:** At this point, the agent should have either: (1) attempted an implementation based on H10's color movement patterns, or (2) explicitly acknowledged uncertainty and made a best-effort guess. Instead, it continued exploratory analysis and hit the iteration limit.

## Root Cause

The agent exhibited severe **hypothesis churn** - testing 10 distinct hypotheses across 20 iterations without committing to implementation. Key failure modes:

1. **No implementation attempts**: All 20 iterations were spent on exploration and hypothesis testing. Zero iterations attempted to write a `solve()` function or generate an answer for the test case.

2. **Insufficient hypothesis validation**: Each hypothesis was tested for 1-3 iterations before being abandoned. The agent didn't invest enough effort to thoroughly validate or refute any single hypothesis.

3. **Missing the solution pattern**: The H10 hypothesis (color movement patterns) appeared promising in iterations 18-19, showing consistent per-color movements. This was likely close to the correct pattern, but the agent never attempted to implement and test it.

4. **No deadline awareness**: The agent showed no urgency or time management. By iteration 15 (75% through), it should have committed to the most promising hypothesis and attempted implementation, even if incomplete.

5. **Analysis paralysis**: The agent got stuck in an "explore more" loop, continuously analyzing shapes, colors, and patterns without synthesizing findings into actionable code.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Iteration budget awareness**: The system should prompt the agent at 50% and 75% of maxIterations with: "You have used N of 20 iterations. Consider committing to an implementation soon."

2. **Forced implementation checkpoint**: After 10-12 iterations of pure exploration, the agent should be required to either: (a) implement a solution based on the best hypothesis so far, or (b) explicitly document why no hypothesis is implementable yet.

3. **Hypothesis commitment protocol**: When a hypothesis shows promise (like H10's color movement patterns), the agent should explicitly decide: "commit to implementation" vs "gather more evidence". The current behavior of moving on to H11 without implementation wastes promising leads.

4. **Better pattern recognition for "on the right track"**: The observations in iterations 18-19 (per-color consistent movements) were a strong signal. A meta-reasoning layer could flag: "This is the most consistent pattern found so far - prioritize implementing it."

5. **Fallback strategy**: By iteration 17-18, when no hypothesis has been validated, the agent should implement the most plausible hypothesis as a fallback, even with low confidence. Returning no answer (score=0) is worse than returning a partially correct answer (score>0).

6. **Plugin: arc-pattern-library**: A reference library of common ARC patterns (path tracing, color-based movement, block encoding) could help the agent recognize this as a "path drawing with per-color offsets" pattern earlier.
