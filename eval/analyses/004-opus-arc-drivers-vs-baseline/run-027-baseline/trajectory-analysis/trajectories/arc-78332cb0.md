# Trajectory: arc-78332cb0

## Task Summary

ARC task with grid transformations: sections of a grid separated by dividers (color 6) are rearranged according to an unknown rule. Three training examples show different transformations:
- Train 0: 11x11 grid with 2x2 section layout → 23x5 grid with 4x1 vertical stack
- Train 1: 17x5 grid with 3x1 vertical stack → 5x17 grid with 1x3 horizontal row (reversed order)
- Train 2: 5x17 grid with 1x3 horizontal row → 17x5 grid with 3x1 vertical stack (same order)

The agent tested 6 distinct hypotheses over 20 iterations but never found a consistent transformation rule that worked across all training examples. Hit max iterations without returning an answer. Score: 0 (timeout).

## Control Flow

```
iter  0  EXPLORE:parse                →  parse training data, display all I/O dimensions

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Sections ordered by count of non-background cells (ascending) | 2-3 | rejected | Train 0: 4,6,7,10 matches; Train 1: all counts=7, no unique order |
| H2 | Sections are individually transposed during rearrangement | 4-5 | rejected | Direct comparison shows sections keep identical content |
| H3 | Ordering determined by shape properties (direction, center, edges) | 6-13 | abandoned | Explored multiple shape features; no consistent pattern found |
| H4 | Entire grid rotated 90° clockwise | 14-16 | rejected | Train 1 & 2 have correct axis flip but Train 0 doesn't match |
| H5 | Sections ordered by shape bias/center position | 17-18 | abandoned | Train 1 vBias correlates; Train 2 doesn't; ran out of time |
| H6 | 2x2 grid uses diagonal reading (main diag, anti-diag) | 19 | abandoned | Matches Train 0 output order but not integrated into full solution |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1→H2→H3(long exploration)→H4→H5→H6 (interrupted by timeout)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Data Exploration and Structure Discovery (iter 0-1)
**Strategy:** Standard ARC probing—parse JSON, examine dimensions, identify patterns

**Effectiveness:** Efficient. Agent quickly identified:
- Grid sections separated by color-6 dividers (full rows/columns of 6s)
- Different input layouts: 2x2 grid, vertical stack, horizontal row
- Output dimensions indicate sections are rearranged

**Assessment:** Good foundation. The agent correctly understood the basic structure: grids are divided into sections by separators, and the task involves rearranging these sections.

### Phase 2: First Hypothesis—Count-Based Ordering (iter 2-3)
**Strategy:** Test if sections are ordered by count of non-background (non-7) cells

**Result:**
- Train 0: TL(4)→BR(6)→TR(7)→BL(10) matches ascending order ✓
- Train 1: All sections have count=7, so ordering cannot be determined by count alone ✗

**Wasted iterations:** 2

**Assessment:** Reasonable first hypothesis (simple, testable), but quickly rejected with counterexample. Agent handled rejection well and moved on.

### Phase 3: Second Hypothesis—Transposition (iter 4-5)
**Strategy:** Test if sections are individually transposed (rows↔columns)

**Result:** Direct comparison showed section content is identical between input and output. Sections are rearranged but not transposed.

**Wasted iterations:** 2

**Assessment:** Another reasonable hypothesis, efficiently tested and rejected. Agent recognized sections are preserved as-is.

### Phase 4: Deep Exploration of Shape Properties (iter 6-13, ~7-8 iterations)
**Strategy:** Since simple rules failed, agent explored geometric properties:
- Bounding boxes
- Centers of mass
- Edge cell counts
- Directional "pointing" (which way shapes extend)

**Approach:**
- Iter 6-7: Noticed ordering differs by case (Train 0: ascending by count, Train 1: reversed, Train 2: same)
- Iter 8-10: Computed bounding boxes and shape centers
- Iter 11: Formulated idea that shapes "point" in directions like arrows
- Iter 12-13: Tried to quantify pointing direction via edge counts—inconclusive

**Result:** No consistent pattern emerged. Agent accumulated observations but couldn't synthesize a unified rule.

**Assessment:** This is where hypothesis churn began. The agent was doing thoughtful analysis (computing geometric features), but without a clear goal or framework. Each iteration added more data without converging toward a solution. **This phase consumed ~40% of total iterations with no actionable outcome.**

### Phase 5: Grid Rotation Hypothesis (iter 14-16)
**Strategy:** Step back to a simpler structural rule—maybe the entire grid layout (not individual sections) rotates 90° clockwise

**Testing:**
- Train 1: vertical (3x1) → horizontal (1x3) matches 90° CW rotation ✓
- Train 2: horizontal (1x3) → vertical (3x1) matches 90° CW rotation ✓
- Train 0: 2x2 grid → 4x1 vertical stack does NOT match 90° CW rotation (which would give 2x2) ✗

**Result:** Partial match but doesn't generalize to all cases.

**Assessment:** Good instinct to test a global transformation rule. The hypothesis was clean and testable, but ultimately failed on Train 0. Agent correctly recognized the failure.

### Phase 6: Shape Bias Hypothesis (iter 17-18)
**Strategy:** Return to shape properties—compute "bias" (how far shape center is from section center) as ordering key

**Result:**
- Train 1: Output order correlates with vBias sorted ascending ✓
- Train 2: Does not correlate ✗

**Assessment:** Yet another partial pattern. Agent was grasping at correlations without a coherent model.

### Phase 7: Diagonal Reading for 2x2 (iter 19)
**Strategy:** Realize Train 0's 2x2→4x1 transformation could use diagonal reading: main diagonal (TL, BR) then anti-diagonal (TR, BL)

**Result:** Matches Train 0 output order perfectly (TL, BR, TR, BL) ✓

**Critical failure:** Agent discovered this at iteration 19 but ran out of iterations before integrating it with the other cases or implementing a solution.

### Phase 8: Timeout (iter 20)
**Decision:** None—agent hit max iterations while still exploring in iteration 19.

**Assessment:** The agent never transitioned from exploration to extraction. No solve() function was written. No answer was returned.

## Root Cause

**Primary failure mode:** Hypothesis churn leading to timeout.

The agent tested 6 distinct hypotheses but never committed to any long enough to refine it into a working solution. The exploration phase consumed all 20 iterations:

1. **No convergence criteria:** Agent didn't establish what "confirmed" means (e.g., "must work on all 3 training examples")
2. **Premature rejection:** Several partial patterns (H1, H4, H6) matched some cases but were abandoned rather than refined
3. **No synthesis:** By iter 19, agent had several partial insights (diagonal reading for 2x2, axis flip for 1D cases) but never combined them into a unified rule
4. **No deadline awareness:** Agent spent 8 iterations (6-13) on geometric feature analysis without progress, consuming 40% of iteration budget on a dead end

**Why no implementation?** The agent never found a hypothesis it trusted enough to code up. In ARC tasks, even an uncertain hypothesis should be implemented and validated on training data before time runs out. This agent stayed in pure exploration mode.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Iteration budget awareness:** After 10-12 iterations of pure exploration, agent should force itself to pick the best partial hypothesis and implement it. ARC tasks often require "commit under uncertainty."

2. **Hypothesis ranking system:** Explicitly track which hypothesis matches the most training examples:
   - H1 (count-based): 1/3 matches → priority 3
   - H4 (90° rotation): 2/3 matches → priority 1 (best so far)
   - H6 (diagonal reading): 1/3 matches but different case → priority 2

3. **Composite hypothesis strategy:** Recognize that the rule might be *case-dependent*:
   - IF 2x2 grid: use diagonal reading (H6)
   - IF 1D (vertical/horizontal): use 90° CW rotation (H4)

   This would have worked! But agent never considered combining multiple partial rules.

4. **Training validation loop:** After formulating a hypothesis, immediately write a solve() function and test on all 3 training examples. This would have:
   - Forced early commitment
   - Revealed which hypotheses are promising
   - Provided concrete error cases to debug

5. **Fallback strategy:** At iteration 18-19, agent should implement the best partial solution (e.g., H4 which worked on 2/3 cases) rather than continuing to explore. Partial credit > timeout.

6. **Pattern: deadline-driven-implementation:** A behavioral pattern for ARC tasks—if exploration exceeds 60% of max iterations without a confirmed hypothesis, switch to "best guess implementation mode" and code up the most promising rule, even if uncertain.
