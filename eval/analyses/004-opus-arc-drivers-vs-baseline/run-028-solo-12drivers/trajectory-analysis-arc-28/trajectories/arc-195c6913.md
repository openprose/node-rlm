# Trajectory: arc-195c6913

## Task Summary

ARC task with 30x30 grids. The task involves finding a pattern where paths are drawn along boundaries between regions. Three training examples with two main colors forming diagonal boundaries, pattern blocks defining repeating sequences, and markers indicating path start points and corner colors. The agent analyzed the structure but ran out of iterations before completing implementation. Score: 0 (timeout).

```

## Hypothesis Log

| ID | Hypothesis | Iters | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| H1 | Path connects marker blocks along boundary with repeating pattern | 4-6 | superseded by H4 | found corners and segments but unclear routing |
| H2 | Simple adjacency defines boundary cells | 7 | rejected | boundary too complex, 40+ cells in Train 0 |
| H3 | Markers define start/end points, path follows region boundary | 8-10 | superseded by H4 | markers identified but path routing unclear |
| H4 | Paths follow staircase boundary between two separated regions of same bg color | 11-19 | **accepted** (incomplete) | successfully identified structure but ran out of time |

**Hypothesis arc:** H1→H2(rejected)→H3→H4(breakthrough, incomplete implementation)

## Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Exploration and Pattern Discovery (iter 0-10)
**Strategy:** Systematic exploration of training examples, comparing inputs to outputs
**Effectiveness:** Highly effective. Agent thoroughly analyzed all three training examples, identifying:
- Two main background colors forming diagonal boundaries
- Pattern blocks at rows 1-2 defining repeating color sequences
- Single-cell markers indicating path start points
- 2x2 blocks indicating corner colors
- Path segments forming L-shapes along boundaries

**Assessment:** Excellent exploration phase. The agent gathered all necessary information and noticed key structures like the 2,2,8 repeating pattern in Train 0 and the corner markers.

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Formation (iter 4-11)
**Strategy:** Multiple hypothesis tests about boundary structure and path routing
**Failures:**
- H1: Could identify path segments but couldn't determine routing algorithm
- H2: Simple adjacency test revealed complex boundary (abandoned after 1 iteration)
- H3: Recognized markers but still unclear on exact path rules

**Breakthrough:** Iter 11 - Agent recognized the "staircase boundary structure" where the 0-region (river) separates two 3-regions (landmasses). The path traces along one region's edge, bouncing between boundaries.

**Assessment:** Good hypothesis iteration with clear breakthrough moment. The agent efficiently tested and rejected simple approaches before finding the correct structure.

### Phase 3: Implementation Attempt (iter 12-19)
**Strategy:** Build complete solve() function with region segmentation, pattern extraction, and path drawing

**Progress:**
- Iter 14: Function definition error (minor setback)
- Iter 15-17: Successfully implemented flood fill and boundary analysis
- Iter 18-19: Built full algorithm including:
  - Two main color detection
  - Pattern block parsing (2x2 blocks to repeating sequence)
  - Single vs 2x2 marker classification
  - Region segmentation
  - Path segment generation

**Result:** Test on Train 0 showed 13/400 cells differ (96.75% correct). The pattern was slightly offset or direction was incorrect. Agent was refining but ran out of iterations.

**Assessment:** Strong implementation progress under time pressure. The core algorithm was nearly correct - the path logic and pattern detection worked, but segment placement had an off-by-one or direction error.

### Phase 4: Timeout (iter 20)
**Decision:** Agent never called return() before max iterations
**Assessment:** Classic deadline failure - spent too much time exploring and not enough implementing early. The agent should have attempted a simpler implementation by iter 10-12 to leave time for debugging.

## Root Cause

The agent timed out without returning an answer. Contributing factors:

1. **Exploration over-investment:** 11 iterations spent on exploration (55% of budget) before attempting implementation
2. **Complex implementation on first try:** The agent attempted a complete, general solution rather than starting with a simpler partial implementation
3. **No return call:** Even when iter 19 showed a 97% correct implementation, the agent didn't call return() with that result
4. **No fallback strategy:** No attempt to return the best available answer when approaching iteration limit

The actual algorithm was nearly correct - the 13-cell difference suggests a minor bug in path direction or corner placement logic.

## What Would Have Helped

1. **Earlier implementation attempts:** Starting implementation by iter 8-10 would have left 10+ iterations for debugging the path routing logic
2. **Incremental testing:** Test simple cases first (e.g., just draw straight line from marker) before full algorithm
3. **Deadline awareness:** Check iteration count and call return() with best available answer when iterations > 18
4. **Simpler first version:** Could have implemented just Train 0's case, verified correctness, then generalized
5. **Code reuse:** The flood fill function error cost an iteration - better to define helper functions once upfront
6. **Structured debugging:** When iter 19 test showed specific cell mismatches, agent should have analyzed the pattern of errors (were corners wrong? was pattern offset?) rather than continuing implementation
7. **Return-early pattern:** Even incomplete answers get partial credit in some ARC tasks - returning the 97% correct grid would have been better than timeout

The core insight (paths trace staircase boundaries between separated regions) was correct and discovered by iter 11. With better time management, this would have been a successful solve.
