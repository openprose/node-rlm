# Contributing to node-rlm

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## How to engage

- **PRs welcome:** Bug fixes, docs improvements, tests, and small features are all appreciated. If something feels like an obvious improvement, feel free to open a PR.
- **Bounce big ideas first:** If you’re planning to sink meaningful time into a new capability, refactor, or architectural change, please open an issue or discussion first so we can align on direction before you invest the effort.
- **Read the project tenets:** This project is guided by a set of evolving tenets. Please read them before doing larger work so your changes line up with the philosophy of the codebase.

A fun exercise, to understand the project tenets, run `prose run .prose/tenet-sync.prose` and follow the prompts to see and refine the current tenets.

Beyond that, follow the patterns you see in the existing code and tests. The README has the details on setup, commands, and project structure.
